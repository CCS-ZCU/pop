This repository serves as a supplementary material for the article "‘Clean this mess up!’ Computer-assisted meta-analysis of populism types in the political science literature", currently under review (April 2023). It contains scripts, data and figures. The scripts are in Python 3 programming language and have a form of Jupyter notebooks. All our analyses aim at being fully reproducible and we invite other scholars to reuse our code and data for their analyses.
