A plea for both\\n',\n 'more and less focus\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n 'Department of Political Science, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands\\n',\n 'Abstract. As a result of the steady rise of populist parties and politicians all over the world – and particularly\\n',\n 'since the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump – populism research has become increasingly\\n',\n 'popular and widespread. The field, however, also faces some tricky challenges. First, it is easy to confuse\\n',\n 'populism with related concepts like, for instance, ‘nativism’ and ‘Euroscepticism’. This brings the risk of\\n',\n 'sloppy conceptualisation, and, as a result, invalid inferences. Second, populism research remains relatively\\n',\n 'detached from adjacent fields,and fruitful fertilisation across literatures is still rather uncommon.In order to\\n',\n 'deal with these challenges,populism research should become both more and less focused.How can these two\\n',\n 'seemingly conflicting recommendations be reconciled? When it comes to conceptualisation/categorisation\\n',\n 'strategies and drawing conclusions from studies by other researchers, populism scholars should employ a\\n',\n 'narrow framework and be precise, distinctive and consistent. Yet when it comes to exploring the literature\\n',\n 'in search of new hypotheses, scholars should employ a more open mind-set. After all, theories developed in\\n',\n 'adjacent fields can inspire populism scholars to formulate innovative new questions and expectations.\\n',\n 'Keyword: populism\\n',\n 'Introduction\\n',\n 'Populism is sexy.Particularly since 2016 – the year of the Brexit referendum and the election\\n',\n 'of Donald Trump – it seems as if journalists just cannot get enough of it. In 2015, The New\\n',\n 'York Times used the terms ‘populism’ or ‘populist’ 671 times. One year later, that number\\n',\n 'had doubled to 1,399. And in 2017, the newspaper employed these words 2,537 times. It\\n',\n 'is therefore unremarkable that in 2017 ‘populism’ was declared word of the year by the\\n',\n 'Cambridge Dictionary. Yet the current allure of the term is not only the result of what\\n',\n 'happened in Britain and the United States; it is the result of the steady rise of populist\\n',\n 'parties and politicians all over the world.\\n',\n 'The increasing appeal of populism is also reflected in academia. Searching the Web of\\n',\n 'Science database reveals that in 2010 ‘only’ 76 articles had been published with the words\\n',\n '‘populism’ or ‘populist’ in the title. In 2015 this number had increased to 155, in 2016 to 208\\n',\n 'and in 2017 to 332. Moreover, an increasing number of conference panels, workshops and\\n',\n 'roundtables are devoted to the topic. There now even is a journal fully devoted to populism!\\n',\n 'It seems safe to conclude that research on populism has become an industry of its own within\\n',\n 'the political science literature.\\n',\n 'In this article I discuss the literature on populism, thereby mainly focusing on the\\n',\n 'books and articles that have emerged in the last decade or so. Of course, given the sheer\\n',\n 'number of recently published studies (see above), I can only refer to a small subsample\\n',\n 'of them here. One of my main aims is to identify lacunas and weaknesses and to provide\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '<image: DeviceRGB, width: 228, height: 45, bpc: 8>HOW TO STUDY POPULISM AND ADJACENT TOPICS?\\n',\n '363\\n',\n 'suggestions for future research. I distinguish two main challenges to the populism literature,\\n',\n 'and provide suggestions for how researchers could deal with them. I conclude by assessing\\n',\n 'what researchers from other fields can learn from populism research, and how (the other\\n',\n 'way around) populism scholars can build on studies on adjacent topics.\\n',\n 'Populism research so far\\n',\n 'Among some academics, the term ‘populism’ had already become attractive half a century\\n',\n 'ago. In 1967, a group of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines came together in London\\n',\n 'to discuss populism – a phenomenon that, according to the editors of the edited volume that\\n',\n 'resulted from this conference, ‘has been more fundamental to the shaping of the political\\n',\n 'mind than is generally acknowledged’ (Ionescu & Gellner 1969:5).The participants strongly\\n',\n 'focused on conceptual issues (what exactly is populism? what are its core characteristics?)\\n',\n 'and descriptions of histories of populism in various countries. The main conclusion was that\\n',\n 'there was no agreement on how to define populism.\\n',\n 'Almost 15 years after the conference, the political theorist Margaret Canovan (1981)\\n',\n 'again underlined the elusiveness of the concept.She compared various instances of populism\\n',\n 'across cases and over time, and made a distinction between seven different types of\\n',\n 'populism. Yet she did not identify a common feature that all these categories of populism\\n',\n 'had in common, and which could be usefully employed in comparative research.\\n',\n 'Until the turn of the millennium, various scholars from different parts of the world –\\n',\n 'mostly Latin America (see Di Tella 1965;Roberts 1995) and the United States (see Goodwyn\\n',\n '1976; Kazin 1995) and to a lesser extent also Europe (see Laclau 1977) – had made various\\n',\n 'important contributions to the populism literature. Yet most of these studies focused on\\n',\n 'specific geographic areas and failed to transcend continental borders.\\n',\n 'The first decade of the 2000s, however, saw a rise of populism studies with a more\\n',\n 'comparative outlook, this time mostly focused on Latin America (see Roberts 2006; De\\n',\n 'la Torre 2010; Weyland 2001) and Europe (see Albertazzi & McDonnell 2008; Mény &\\n',\n 'Surel 2002) (see Taggart 2000 for a more general approach). These more recent studies\\n',\n 'still struggled with conceptual issues. In general, however, they focused more strongly\\n',\n 'than their predecessors on empirical data and assessed instances of populism by means\\n',\n 'of (comparative) case studies. Most of these studies assessed why and how certain parties\\n',\n 'or leaders were populist and considered the question of why populist actors had become\\n',\n 'increasingly successful.\\n',\n 'The last decade or so is characterised by an explosion of populism studies in the form of\\n',\n 'monographs (see Moffitt 2016; Müller 2016; Van Kessel 2015), edited volumes (see Kriesi &\\n',\n 'Pappas 2015; Rovira Kaltwasser et al. 2017; Zaslove & Wolinetz 2018), journal articles (see\\n',\n 'Akkerman et al. 2014; Bonikowski & Gidron 2015; Müller et al. 2017) and working papers\\n',\n '(see Inglehart & Norris 2016;Hawkins et al.2012).In general,new studies differ from earlier\\n',\n 'work on populism in various ways.\\n',\n 'First, scholars agree with each other much more strongly than before on how the term\\n',\n 'should be defined. Although populism is still a highly contested concept, and researchers\\n',\n 'still struggle with conceptual issues, many scholars nowadays agree that it should be defined\\n',\n 'as a set of ideas that concerns the antagonistic relationship between the corrupt elite and\\n',\n 'the virtuous people. As a concept, populism thus consists of at least two sub-dimensions:\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '364\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n 'people-centrism and anti-elitism. Whether scholars define populism as a thin ideology\\n',\n '(Mudde 2004; Stanley 2008), a discourse (Hawkins 2010) or a style (Moffitt 2016), the\\n',\n 'large share of populism scholars endorsing the so-called ‘ideational approach’ agrees that\\n',\n 'populism is a substantive message that should be distinguished from related but different\\n',\n 'phenomena like ‘organisation’ or ‘leadership’. But although this is without any doubt an\\n',\n 'important step forward, much work still needs to be done on what exactly is the genus of\\n',\n 'populism. As a set of ideas, should it be conceived of as a discourse, an ideology or a style?\\n',\n 'Second, and this is most probably due to the fact that scholars increasingly agree on\\n',\n 'how to define the term, the emphasis on conceptualising populism has made place for a\\n',\n 'focus on measuring it. The ideational approach to populism (i.e., the belief that populism\\n',\n 'is a set of ideas) implies that political actors can endorse populism to a lesser or larger\\n',\n 'extent. As a result, various researchers have investigated to what extent political parties and\\n',\n 'politicians express populist messages – mostly by means of quantitative content analysis\\n',\n 'methods. Jagers and Walgrave (2007), for instance, have assessed political party broadcasts,\\n',\n 'Hawkins (2010) political speeches, Rooduijn and Pauwels (2011) election manifestos and\\n',\n 'Engesser et al. (2017) social media messages. Of course, the degree of populism of parties\\n',\n 'and politicians could also be assessed in other ways. Polk et al. (2017), for instance, make use\\n',\n 'of expert surveys (but only focus on anti-elitism), and Stavrakakis et al. (2017) ask survey\\n',\n 'questions to assess how populist politicians are. Yet when it comes to measuring populism,\\n',\n 'a lot of work still needs to be done. What is still rather unclear, for instance, is how exactly\\n',\n 'people-centrism and anti-elitism relate to each other.For instance,should anti-elitism always\\n',\n 'be accompanied by people-centrism in order for populism to be present?\\n',\n 'A third way in which more recent research on populism differs from earlier work is that\\n',\n 'populism studies nowadays also focus on other actors than politicians and parties.In general,\\n',\n 'there has been a shift from the supply side of the political spectrum to the demand side.What\\n',\n 'do voters for populist parties have in common (see Pauwels 2014)? Although we know a\\n',\n 'great deal already when it comes to the electorates of right-wing populist parties, we know\\n',\n 'only very little about those who vote for left-wing populist parties or populist parties in\\n',\n 'general. In addition, a rapidly growing literature assesses public opinion by investigating to\\n',\n 'what extent individual citizens have populist ideas. Hawkins et al. (2012) and Akkerman\\n',\n 'et al. (2014) were among the first to demonstrate that populism can also be measured as\\n',\n 'an attitude among voters.1 Recent studies have built on these findings and investigated how\\n',\n 'to validly measure these attitudes (across cases) and how these attitudes affect vote choice\\n',\n '(Schulz et al. 2017; Spruyt et al. 2016; Van Hauwaert & Van Kessel 2018). In addition to\\n',\n 'focusing on voting behaviour and public opinion, scholars have also begun to investigate\\n',\n 'to what extent voting for populists has psychological roots in personality (Bakker et al.\\n',\n '2016; Fatke 2019) or emotions (Rico et al. 2017). This focus on the demand side leads to\\n',\n 'many new interesting questions and challenges. For instance, it has still not been shown\\n',\n 'convincingly that the populist attitude really differs from other attitudinal constructs like\\n',\n '‘political cynicism’ or ‘external efficacy’. To what extent is the populist attitude not just old\\n',\n 'wine in new bottles?\\n',\n 'Fourth, various important recent contributions to populism research have been made by\\n',\n 'communication scientists (Krämer 2014). As a set of ideas, populism is also widespread in\\n',\n 'mass media (Rooduijn 2014). An important question is whether and to what extent populist\\n',\n 'messages in media affect public opinion (see Aalberg et al. 2017). Recent experimental\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'HOW TO STUDY POPULISM AND ADJACENT TOPICS?\\n',\n '365\\n',\n 'studies, for instance, have shown that the populist set of ideas can exert an effect on\\n',\n 'attitudes of individual citizens (see Hameleers et al. 2017). Such studies form an important\\n',\n 'contribution to the literature because they combine supply- and demand-side variables and\\n',\n 'assess how individual citizens respond to populist messages. Yet a drawback is that the\\n',\n 'ecological validity of such experimental studies often is rather low: do the effects also hold\\n',\n 'in real life, and if so, for how long? An innovative recent study tackles this issue by linking\\n',\n 'content analysis data to panel studies (Müller et al. 2017).\\n',\n 'Fifth, and finally, scholars increasingly assess populism in power. This is, of course, due\\n',\n 'to the fact that in recent years populist parties (at least in Europe) have on average become\\n',\n 'much more experienced with government participation.Only think of Syriza and Anexartitoi\\n',\n 'Ellines (Independent Greeks,ANEL) in Greece,the Fremskrittspartiet (Progress Party,FrP)\\n',\n 'in Norway and the Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs (Freedom Party, FPÖ) in Austria. This\\n',\n 'raises the question to what extent populists are able to actually deliver on their electoral\\n',\n 'promises (Albertazzi & McDonnell 2015). Relatedly, scholars increasingly focus on the\\n',\n 'extent to which populists harm liberal democracy.When it comes to the relationship between\\n',\n 'populism and (liberal) democracy, early studies mainly assessed the theoretical tension\\n',\n 'between the two (Canovan 1981). Recent studies, however, also assess the consequences of\\n',\n 'populism for how democracy actually functions (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2012; Müller\\n',\n '2016).\\n',\n 'Hence, populism research is booming. Yet the field also faces some tricky challenges.\\n',\n 'Below I present two of these challenges and some recommendations on how scholars could\\n',\n 'deal with them.\\n',\n 'Challenge 1: It is easy to confuse populism with related concepts\\n',\n 'As I have argued in the introduction of this article, populism has become a fancy buzzword.\\n',\n 'This is not strange given that parties and politicians that are generally characterised as\\n',\n 'populist (e.g., Trump, Marine Le Pen (Front National, FN) and Geert Wilders (Partij\\n',\n 'voor de Vrijheid, PVV)) have become increasingly successful in the last decade. Because\\n',\n 'the core message of these parties is that one’s own nation is threatened by Muslims,\\n',\n 'immigrants and other alleged ‘dangerous others’, many journalists and academics have\\n',\n 'come to the conclusion that nationalistic exclusionism is one of the core characteristics of\\n',\n 'populism.\\n',\n 'This conclusion is wrong. It is a consequence of confusing populism with a related (but\\n',\n 'different) phenomenon: nativism (see De Cleen et al. 2018). Nativism is ‘an ideology, which\\n',\n 'holds that states should be inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (“the\\n',\n 'nation”) and that nonnative elements (persons and ideas) are fundamentally threatening\\n',\n 'to the homogenous nation-state’ (Mudde 2007: 19). Where populism concerns the vertical\\n',\n 'relationship between ‘the people’ and ‘the elite’,nativism is about the horizontal antagonism\\n',\n 'between ‘the nation’ and ‘dangerous others’ (see also Bonikowski 2017; Rydgren 2005).\\n',\n 'Conflating populism with nativism is not a minor problem. It could lead to highly flawed\\n',\n 'conclusions.\\n',\n 'Let me give an example. Time and again, studies have shown that citizens who vote for\\n',\n 'European populist parties like FN and FPÖ are lower educated citizens (see Arzheimer\\n',\n '2009; Lubbers et al. 2002). Do these findings legitimise the conclusion that the lower\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '366\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n 'educated are more likely to vote for populists? Certainly not. These studies show that\\n',\n 'the lower educated are more likely to vote for radical right-wing populists – who are also\\n',\n 'nativist – but cannot tell us anything about the relationship between education and voting\\n',\n 'for populists in general. After all, the broader category of ‘populists in general’ also includes\\n',\n 'left-wing populists like Syriza in Greece or Podemos in Spain. Such parties conceive of ‘the\\n',\n 'people’ in a much more inclusionary way, and are not nativist at all. In fact, in many cases\\n',\n 'the lower educated are not more likely to vote for such parties (Rooduijn 2017). Hence, the\\n',\n 'fact that lower educated citizens vote for radical right-wing populist parties has not much to\\n',\n 'do with these parties’ populism. Most likely it is their nativism that makes them attractive\\n',\n 'to lower educated voters.\\n',\n 'To prevent drawing such wrong inferences,it is of the upmost importance to:(1) carefully\\n',\n 'conceptualise populism, building on existing studies, and distinguishing it from related\\n',\n 'concepts; (2) carefully categorise parties (and other actors) based on this conceptualisation;\\n',\n '(3) choose a research design that logically follows from, and is consistent with, the chosen\\n',\n 'conceptualisation and categorisation strategy; and (4) evaluate the research findings of\\n',\n 'others based on these same strict criteria.\\n',\n 'How to do that? Table 1 and 2 in the Online Appendix might help. These tables give an\\n',\n 'overview of various types of parties (populist, far right, far left, Eurosceptic and challenger\\n',\n 'parties) and their definitions, and present an overview of party categorisations based on\\n',\n 'these definitions.(Of course,neither these definitions nor the categorisations are undisputed.\\n',\n 'Yet the definitions are clear, concise, coherent and well-established in the literature, and\\n',\n 'the categorisations logically follow from these conceptualisations.) To give an indication of\\n',\n 'how complicated the patchwork is that these overlapping typologies form, Figure 1 below\\n',\n 'focuses on just two countries: Italy and Greece (see Table 2 in the Online Appendix for the\\n',\n 'full party names).The figure shows that:(1) a populist party need not be a Eurosceptic party\\n',\n '(FI), a far left or right party (FI and M5S) or a challenger party (SYR, FI, ANEL and LN);\\n',\n '<image: DeviceGray, width: 2134, height: 1074, bpc: 8>Figure 1. Some of the main contemporary populist, far left/right, Eurosceptic and challenger parties in Italy\\n',\n 'and Greece (for full party names, see the Online Appendix).\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'HOW TO STUDY POPULISM AND ADJACENT TOPICS?\\n',\n '367\\n',\n '(2) a Eurosceptic party need not be a populist party (KKE and Golden Dawn), a far left\\n',\n 'or right party (M5S) or a challenger party (SYR, ANEL and LN); (3) a far left/right party\\n',\n 'need not be a populist party (SEL and KKE regarding the far left and Golden Dawn vis-à-\\n',\n 'vis the far right), a Eurosceptic party (SEL) or a challenger party (SYR, ANEL, LN); and\\n',\n '(4) a challenger party need not be a populist party (SEL, KKE, Greens, Golden Dawn), a\\n',\n 'Eurosceptic party (SEL and Greens) or a far left or right party (M5S or Greens).\\n',\n 'Figure 1 makes clear that, in order to draw the right conclusions, researchers should be\\n',\n 'very careful regarding conceptualisation, categorisation and research design issues. If the\\n',\n 'main aim is,for instance,to assess to what extent the electoral successes of parties like the FN,\\n',\n 'FPÖ and PVV have had an impact on mainstream parties’ immigration positions, it makes\\n',\n 'much more sense to focus on nativism as a central concept than on populism. After all, it\\n',\n 'is their nativism and not their populism that can be expected to affect mainstream parties’\\n',\n 'immigration positions. In other words: researchers should never emphasise the concept of\\n',\n 'populism just because it is such an appealing term.\\n',\n 'Challenge 2: Populism research remains relatively detached from adjacent fields\\n',\n 'This plea for conceptual and methodological focus does not imply that populism researchers\\n',\n 'should only focus on their ‘own’ field and that the populism literature should become more\\n',\n 'detached from adjacent fields. Quite the contrary. The goal of social science concepts and\\n',\n 'theories is to help us better understand real world phenomena. The main strength of the\\n',\n 'concept of populism is that it helps us understand phenomena like Brexit and Trump.\\n',\n 'After all, the message that the virtuous people are exploited or betrayed by a corrupt\\n',\n 'elite was an indispensable ingredient of the rhetoric of many of the Brexiteers (like, for\\n',\n 'instance, Nigel Farage), and it was an essential element of the election campaign of Donald\\n',\n 'Trump.\\n',\n 'However, it is important to realise that populism was by no means the only element that\\n',\n 'the Brexit and Trump campaigns had in common, and which made them so successful. In\\n',\n 'fact, it was not even the most important one. Arguably, the core driver of both the Brexit\\n',\n 'and Trump vote was nativism (see Mudde 2017: Chapter 21). Although many people voting\\n',\n 'in favour of Brexit and Trump were worried or angry about condescending economic and\\n',\n 'political elites, most of them were particularly worried about immigration and the alleged\\n',\n 'threat that immigrants and their ideas pose for the nation-state. This means that although\\n',\n 'populism helps us understand phenomena like Brexit and Trump, for a full understanding\\n',\n 'of these phenomena it is of essential importance to assess how populism is associated with\\n',\n 'related ideologies and messages like Euroscepticism and nativism.\\n',\n 'Unfortunately, however, fruitful fertilisation across different literatures is still rather\\n',\n 'uncommon. In fact, one of the main problems of contemporary populism research is that\\n',\n 'it remains too detached from adjacent literatures. As a result, we know only relatively\\n',\n 'little about how exactly populism relates to concepts like ‘Euroscepticism’ and ‘nativism’.\\n',\n 'Moreover, it is still rather uncommon for theories and hypotheses in populism research to\\n',\n 'be informed by research in other fields. Take, for instance, the literature on ‘anti-political-\\n',\n 'establishment parties’ (Abedi 2002). These parties\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '368\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n 'draw up a triangular symbolic space by (simultaneously) constructing three actors and\\n',\n 'their relationships:the political class,the people and themselves … .The first represents\\n',\n 'the malicious rogue, the second the innocent victim and the third the redeeming hero.\\n',\n 'While citizens and anti-political-establishment actors live in peace and harmony, their\\n',\n 'relationship with the political establishment is deeply antagonistic.(Schedler 1996:293)\\n',\n 'This description of anti-political-establishment parties is almost equal to how most\\n',\n 'scholars nowadays conceptualise populist parties. The only difference is that populism is\\n',\n 'a more general concept that also includes the antagonistic relationship between ‘the people’\\n',\n 'and other types of elites like,for instance,‘untrustworthy bankers’(economic elites),‘snobby\\n',\n 'intellectuals’ (cultural elites) and ‘fake news spreading journalists’ (media elites).\\n',\n 'Because of the commonalities between these concepts, the literature on anti-political-\\n',\n 'establishment parties can be highly informative for populism research. It has, for\\n',\n 'instance,been shown that anti-political-establishment parties that participate in government\\n',\n 'coalitions experience an ‘additional cost of governing’ (Van Spanje 2011): they lose more\\n',\n 'seats than governing parties lose on average – most likely because their anti-political-\\n',\n 'establishment message is not very compatible with participation in a government coalition,\\n',\n 'together with traditional establishment parties. Although we cannot conclude from these\\n',\n 'findings alone that populist parties will also experience an additional cost of governing –\\n',\n 'there are quite some differences between the parties that are generally categorised as ‘anti-\\n',\n 'political-establishment’ and those that are commonly classified as ‘populist’ – the general\\n',\n 'line of reasoning can be tailored to populist parties and inform interesting new research\\n',\n 'questions and hypotheses. It could, for instance, be expected that the more populist a party’s\\n',\n 'discourse is, the more severely it will be punished by voters after having participated in a\\n',\n 'government coalition. Unfortunately, however, communication between these two strands\\n',\n 'of research has so far remained rather limited.\\n',\n 'Another, more distant, field that only rarely informs populism studies is the one focusing\\n',\n 'on in-group/out-group thinking. Populism is an antagonistic set of ideas dividing the world\\n',\n 'into an in-group (the people) and an out-group (the elite). As such, it could be conceived\\n',\n 'of as a concrete manifestation of the more general predisposition to reduce society to ‘us’\\n',\n 'and ‘them’. According to such a general predisposition, ‘[m]embers of in-groups (until they\\n',\n 'prove otherwise) are assumed to be virtuous: friendly, cooperative, trustworthy, safe, and\\n',\n 'more. Members of out-groups (until they prove otherwise) are assumed to be the opposite:\\n',\n 'unfriendly, uncooperative, unworthy of trust, dangerous, and more’ (Kinder & Kam 2010:\\n',\n '8). There is a vast literature on such in-group/out-group thinking (mostly conducted by\\n',\n 'psychologists and public opinion scholars), and it has quite convincingly been demonstrated\\n',\n 'that attitudes towards various out-groups are related and may in fact reflect a single\\n',\n 'underlying general predisposition (Ekehammar et al. 2004; Zick et al. 2008). Although most\\n',\n 'of these studies so far have assessed nativist attitudes (towards immigrants and other ethnic\\n',\n 'groups), the general logic of contraposing the in-group against the out-group is the same\\n',\n 'when it comes to populism. Therefore, research on in-group/out-group thinking could and\\n',\n 'should become an important source of inspiration for populism scholars (see Schulz et al.\\n',\n '2018).\\n',\n 'Of course, it remains of the upmost importance to keep in mind that populism and\\n',\n 'nativism (and attitudes concerning other in- and out-groups) are different phenomena\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'HOW TO STUDY POPULISM AND ADJACENT TOPICS?\\n',\n '369\\n',\n '(see Challenge 1 above), and should therefore not be conflated conceptually. It is also\\n',\n 'important, however, to realise that there is a lot that they do have in common. Hence, future\\n',\n 'studies might want to look at the extent to which populism and nativism (and other related\\n',\n 'concepts) are related to each other. Both are concrete manifestations of in-group/out-group\\n',\n 'thinking, so it might well be the case that at the individual level the two attitudes reinforce\\n',\n 'each other (see Bonikowski & Zhang 2017).\\n',\n 'The solution for the lack of cross-fertilisation between literatures is relatively easy\\n',\n '(though not so easily implemented): populism scholars (and also researchers focusing on\\n',\n 'adjacent topics) should look beyond ‘their own’ field and adopt a wider framework.Findings\\n',\n 'from studies on topic X can be very relevant and inform hypotheses on topic Y. A wider\\n',\n 'framework might well lead to many new interesting hypotheses as well as better scholarly\\n',\n 'communication across literatures.\\n',\n 'Conclusion and discussion\\n',\n 'The literature on populism has exploded in recent years. Moreover, as a result of the Brexit\\n',\n 'and Trump votes, academic attention to the topic can be expected to grow even further\\n',\n 'in the years to come. In this article, I have provided an overview of populism research\\n',\n 'so far, and I have identified various lacunas and weaknesses. Moreover, I have discussed\\n',\n 'two main challenges for the literature on populism. The first challenge is that it is easy\\n',\n 'to confuse populism with related concepts like ‘nativism’ and ‘Euroscepticism’. This is\\n',\n 'highly problematic because it leads to confusion and increases the risk of drawing invalid\\n',\n 'conclusions.Second,populism research has remained relatively detached from literatures on\\n',\n 'related topics. This is inconvenient because it hampers the development of innovative new\\n',\n 'research questions and hypotheses. To deal with these challenges, I have argued in favour of\\n',\n 'both more and less focus within populism studies. How can these two seemingly conflicting\\n',\n 'recommendations be reconciled?\\n',\n 'When it comes to conceptualising their main concepts,classifying the parties they include\\n',\n 'in their analyses, designing their research and drawing conclusions from studies conducted\\n',\n 'by other researchers, populism scholars should employ a narrow framework and be precise,\\n',\n 'distinctive and consistent. This does not mean, however, that they should only stick to\\n',\n 'populism studies,and turn away from research that assesses related but different phenomena\\n',\n 'like, for instance, nativism and Euroscepticism. Oftentimes the theoretical arguments made\\n',\n 'in such studies can, with only some minor adaptations, be transformed into innovative new\\n',\n 'questions and hypotheses about populism. Hence, when it comes to exploring the literature\\n',\n 'in search for new hypotheses, scholars should employ a more open mind-set.\\n',\n 'Populism research can thus learn a lot from adjacent fields. Scholars of, for instance,\\n',\n 'anti-political-establishment parties have developed theories that can relatively easily be\\n',\n 'transformed into hypotheses about populism. At the same time, adjacent literatures can\\n',\n 'also learn a lot from populism research. In order to fully understand phenomena like\\n',\n 'Euroscepticism, polarisation and the rise of challenger parties, one should have, at the very\\n',\n 'least, a basic understanding of populism.\\n',\n 'Unfortunately, however, it is likely that the problem of conceptual blurriness – and,\\n',\n 'hence, the risk of drawing wrong conclusions – becomes more instead of less acute in the\\n',\n 'years to come.For many scholars the sexiness of populism is an incentive to employ the term\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '370\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n '– even if the real focus is on a different topic.Although this will likely increase the popularity\\n',\n 'of the field even further, in the end it will most probably also lead to more conceptual\\n',\n 'blurriness, sloppy inferences and invalid conclusions.\\n',\n 'Acknowledgments\\n',\n 'I would like to thank Stijn van Kessel, Andrej Zaslove and two anonymous reviewers for\\n',\n 'their useful feedback.Luke March,Andrea Pirro and Paul Taggart have helped to categorise\\n',\n 'the parties in the Online Appendix.

      "text/plain": "['European politics is going through a period of profound transformation. \\n',\n 'This can be seen in the structures of representation: traditional political \\n',\n 'parties are losing support; new parties are emerging; and national parlia-\\n',\n 'ments are splintering into larger numbers of smaller groups. It can also be \\n',\n 'seen in the balance between representative democracy and direct democ-\\n',\n 'racy: referendums are increasing in frequency and importance; political \\n',\n 'parties are developing new instruments for harnessing popular input; and \\n',\n 'non-majoritarian institutions, such as ‘politically independent’ central \\n',\n 'banks, and supranational organisations, such as the European Union, are \\n',\n 'facing challenges to their legitimacy, as well as calls for more comprehen-\\n',\n 'sive political oversight. Finally, it can be seen in the style of politics: the old \\n',\n 'rules of comity, collegiality and discourse are weakening; identity politics, \\n',\n 'both positive (‘us’) and negative (‘them’), is gaining prominence; and polar-\\n',\n 'isation is replacing consensus as the norm. \\n',\n 'Analysts and commentators have tried to capture the many dimensions \\n',\n 'of this transformation with the word ‘populism’. They often use modifiers \\n',\n 'to signal some larger ideological orientation, such as ‘nationalist’, ‘author-\\n',\n 'itarian’, ‘separatist’, ‘right-wing’ or ‘left-wing’. Unfortunately, as the \\n',\n 'published literature on this topic has rapidly increased, a gap has opened \\n',\n 'between the scholarly use of the term ‘populism’ and its meaning (or use) \\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What \\n',\n 'Scholarship Tells Us\\n',\n 'Erik Jones\\n',\n 'Erik Jones is Professor of European Studies and Director of European and Eurasian Studies at the Paul H. Nitze \\n',\n 'School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), Johns Hopkins University; Senior Research Associate at the \\n',\n 'Istituto per gli Studi di Politica Internazionale in Milan; and a contributing editor to Survival.\\n',\n 'Survival  |  vol. 61 no. 4  |  August–September 2019 |  pp. 7–30 \\n',\n 'DOI 10.1080/00396338.2019.1637125\\n',\n '8  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'in conventional speech. This gap creates ambiguity in the interpretation of \\n',\n 'the term that distorts or limits the insights that analysts can garner from \\n',\n 'scholarly research and argument. This distortion is particularly important \\n',\n 'whenever scholarly definitions are used as the basis for data coding in \\n',\n 'statistical analysis: analysts using a conventional-speech interpretation of \\n',\n 'the term run the risk of drawing inferences from statistical models without \\n',\n 'understanding precisely what the data means.\\n',\n 'Policing the use of language in popular commentary on Europe’s political \\n',\n 'transformation is an impossible task. Hence, even in the best-case scenario, \\n',\n 'the gap between academic and non-academic use of ‘populism’ as a concept \\n',\n 'will remain significant. If anything, variations in the academic usage of the \\n',\n 'term – and in the application of modifiers by scholars to add nuance to what \\n',\n 'they are studying – is likely to increase. The only solution for ensuring that \\n',\n 'academic work remains accessible to analysts outside academia is to place \\n',\n 'such work in a wider intellectual context, sketching the broad contours of \\n',\n 'academic debates on the transformation of European politics and exposing \\n',\n 'the role of populism, in its various guises, within those dynamics.\\n',\n 'The purpose of this review is to map four dimensions of the scholarly \\n',\n 'literature: what scholars are seeing, how they explain it, what the implica-\\n',\n 'tions are and how they manifest differently from one country to the next.1 In \\n',\n 'doing so, this review relies more heavily on books than on journal articles. \\n',\n 'It also incorporates a significant number of works that fall more clearly in \\n',\n 'the ‘public intellectual’ category than in the narrower contemporary defini-\\n',\n 'tion of ‘academic scholarship’. That choice reflects an ambition to bridge \\n',\n 'the gap between conventional-speech discussion of Europe’s political trans-\\n',\n 'formation and the wider scholarly literature. The literature on populism in \\n',\n 'Europe is expanding at a frenetic pace, particularly in journals. Book-length \\n',\n 'treatments tend to provide a first attempt at synthesis. This review is an \\n',\n 'attempt at further distillation.\\n',\n 'What are we seeing?\\n',\n 'When scholars point to the rise of populism, they have a very specific notion \\n',\n 'of it in mind. That notion is important methodologically. Conceptually, \\n',\n 'however, there has been some confusion as both scholars and other analysts \\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What Scholarship Tells Us  |  9 \\n',\n 'have tried to describe or characterise the many transformations under way \\n',\n 'in European politics. As a result, any narrow discussion of populism rapidly \\n',\n 'broadens to encompass the decline of traditional political parties, the rise of \\n',\n 'nationalism and identity politics, and the turn away from democratic insti-\\n',\n 'tutions toward more authoritarian structures.\\n',\n 'The most popular academic definition of populism comes from a 2004 \\n',\n 'essay by Cas Mudde called ‘The Populist Zeitgeist’. In that essay, Mudde \\n',\n 'defines populism as ‘an ideology that considers society to be ultimately sep-\\n',\n 'arated into two homogenous and antagonistic groups, “the pure people” \\n',\n 'versus “the corrupt elite”, and which argues that politics should be an \\n',\n 'expression of the volonté générale (general will) of the people’. Mudde goes \\n',\n 'on to explain that populism is only ‘a thin centered ideology’ that ‘can be \\n',\n 'easily combined with … other ideologies, including communism, ecologism, \\n',\n 'nationalism or socialism’.2 In this way, Mudde is able to make connections \\n',\n 'between the protest movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s on the \\n',\n 'political left, and the more nationalistic or xenophobic movements that \\n',\n 'emerged on the political right in the 1980s and 1990s. This definition is \\n',\n 'popular because it feeds into a ‘manifesto’ approach to identifying popu-\\n',\n 'list groups and distinguishing them from other political movements that \\n',\n 'relies on coding the language used in political speeches or documents – or \\n',\n 'on expert assessments as to how that language should be coded – to deter-\\n',\n 'mine how well different groups fit the definition. Any group that pits a pure \\n',\n 'people against a corrupt elite is populist; any group that fails to make that \\n',\n 'distinction is not.\\n',\n 'There are reasons to be sceptical that this definition captures the full \\n',\n 'extent of the political challenges facing European democracies. When \\n',\n 'popular commentators refer to the ‘populist threat to democracy’, they \\n',\n 'are usually speaking about something bigger and more complicated than \\n',\n 'the rhetorical turns deployed by specific political parties as they claim \\n',\n 'to represent the people and criticise the elite. Moreover, scholars of \\n',\n 'populism have never claimed that the phenomenon they study is compre-\\n',\n 'hensive. On the contrary, they usually push in the opposite direction in \\n',\n 'the hopes of bringing greater precision to the analysis of political parties. \\n',\n 'This strategy is very successful in ring-fencing a conversation about how \\n',\n '10  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'specific political parties – or the competition between political parties – \\n',\n 'have changed over time.\\n',\n 'It is not difficult to find prominent authors who mirror the language \\n',\n 'used in Mudde’s definition, even if they do not cite his work. Hence, The \\n',\n 'Populist Explosion by John Judis starts off insisting that it is ‘a mistake’ \\n',\n 'to try to define populism ‘like entropy or photosynthesis’, and yet later \\n',\n 'concedes that it is important to highlight the distinction between ‘the ordi-\\n',\n 'nary people’ and ‘their elite opponents’, if only to acknowledge that these \\n',\n 'concepts have different interpretations on the left and right. For Judis, \\n',\n 'the important point is that ‘the exact referents of “the people” and “the \\n',\n 'elite” don’t define populism; what defines it is the conflictual relation-\\n',\n 'ship between the two’.3 In the same vein, Jan-Werner Müller makes it clear \\n',\n 'in What Is Populism? that ‘it is a necessary but not sufficient condition to \\n',\n 'be critical of elites in order to count as a populist’. He explains that, ‘in \\n',\n 'addition to being anti-elitist, populists are always anti-pluralist. Populists \\n',\n 'claim that they, and they alone, represent the people.’4 A third illustra-\\n',\n 'tion comes from Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart. In Cultural Backlash, \\n',\n 'they assert that ‘populism is understood … minimally as a style of rhetoric \\n',\n 'reflecting first-order principles about who should rule, claiming that legit-\\n',\n 'imate power rests with “the people” not the elites’.5 These notions are all \\n',\n 'subtly different. Mudde talks about an ideology, Judis focuses on a pattern \\n',\n 'of conflict, Müller emphasises rhetoric, and Norris and Inglehart highlight \\n',\n 'implicit claims to legitimacy. The point to note is that these notions con-\\n',\n 'verge on language as the primary indicator, coding populists based on \\n',\n 'what they say in their political speeches and documents.\\n',\n 'This coding strategy is widespread and makes it possible for scholars to \\n',\n 'map the growth in support for populist parties across different countries \\n',\n 'using a common definition. Norris and Inglehart provide a good illustra-\\n',\n 'tion of this kind of coding strategy, both in terms of the narrow focus on \\n',\n 'populism – which they juxtapose with pluralism – and across an array of \\n',\n 'other political dimensions (captured primarily through expert surveys) that \\n',\n 'provide the underlying structure for party competition.6 In this way, they \\n',\n 'can show that support for populist parties has increased since the 1940s from \\n',\n 'just over 5% of the electorate across 32 Western countries to just over 12% \\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What Scholarship Tells Us  |  11 \\n',\n 'by the 2010s.7 The technique is far from perfect, however. For example, it is \\n',\n 'never clear how Norris and Inglehart can use contemporary expert surveys \\n',\n 'to code political parties that competed in the 1950s and 1960s. Presumably \\n',\n 'the coding of those earlier contests relied more heavily on analysis derived \\n',\n 'from the comparative party-manifesto project.\\n',\n 'What is even less clear is how to interpret this increase. The big jump \\n',\n 'comes between the 1970s, at 5.8% support for populist parties, and the \\n',\n '1980s, with 10.9%. Moreover, the data gives no reason to believe that \\n',\n 'there is anything new about populism in Western democracies, but only \\n',\n 'that support for populist parties has increased. Since one party’s gain is \\n',\n 'another party’s loss, it may be more relevant to ask \\n',\n 'what happened to the political forces that used to \\n',\n 'keep the populists at bay. The declining impor-\\n',\n 'tance of mainstream or traditional political parties \\n',\n 'is another development that has captured consid-\\n',\n 'erable scholarly attention. Peter Mair’s Ruling the \\n',\n 'Void is a good illustration.8 Virtually every standard \\n',\n 'work on the rise of populism, however, treats the decline of mainstream \\n',\n 'political parties as a secondary phenomenon.\\n',\n 'The rise of nationalism or nationalist sentiments is another trend that has \\n',\n 'drawn the interest of scholars. Most take pains to distinguish between nation-\\n',\n 'alism and populism, often using one term to modify the other, as in ‘national \\n',\n 'populism’ or ‘populist nationalism’. Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin \\n',\n 'explain in National Populism that ‘national populists prioritize the culture \\n',\n 'and interests of the nation and promise to give voice to a people who feel \\n',\n 'that they have been neglected, even held in contempt, by distant and often \\n',\n 'corrupt elites’.9 Meanwhile, Sergio Fabbrini argues that ‘nationalist popu-\\n',\n 'lism’ is anti-technocratic and anti-European, while ‘populist nationalism’ is \\n',\n 'more obviously anti-immigration; his point is that while the two different \\n',\n 'tendencies may work together, they remain distinct. The key to unpack-\\n',\n 'ing this distinction is to see ‘nationalist populism’ as an attempt to save the \\n',\n 'nation from the rule of experts, both at home and abroad. By contrast, popu-\\n',\n 'list nationalism is focused more clearly on traditional values and cultures, \\n',\n 'which need to be rescued from both immigration and cosmopolitanism.10 \\n',\n 'Support for \\n',\n 'populist parties \\n',\n 'has increased\\n',\n '12  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'This distinction is challenging to make cleanly in abstract terms, and yet it is \\n',\n 'important to unlock the Italian case (discussed in more detail below).\\n',\n 'What is worth noting, however, is that this distinction between \\n',\n 'nationalism and populism is historically inaccurate – at least given the \\n',\n 'definition of populism embraced by most scholars. Nationalism developed \\n',\n 'in late-eighteenth-century Germany to liberate the German people (and \\n',\n 'their culture) from a corrupt, Francophile elite. This romantic nationalism \\n',\n 'worked to establish ‘the people’ as a coherent group and to tie political \\n',\n 'legitimacy to the service of that group. In doing so, romantic nationalism \\n',\n 'created a positive form of identity politics while at the same time encouraging \\n',\n 'negative forms of identity politics, such as xenophobia.11 Francis Fukuyama \\n',\n 'picks up on this theme in Identity by sketching two different dynamics, one \\n',\n 'through which efforts to represent repressed or disadvantaged identities \\n',\n 'lead to the splintering of the political community into ever smaller groups, \\n',\n 'and another through which identities asserted on one side of the political \\n',\n 'spectrum encourage political actors on the other side to respond with their \\n',\n 'own form of identity politics, often using the same arguments and rhetoric.12 \\n',\n 'Thus, the rise of nationalism and nationalist sentiments is part of the wider \\n',\n 'turn to identity politics, all of which wraps around the notion of populism.\\n',\n 'A fourth indicator of change is the turn to more authoritarian political \\n',\n 'institutions. Here the conceptual link rests on two foundations: the corrup-\\n',\n 'tion of the ruling elite, which will presumably use any means to retain its \\n',\n 'control; and the homogeneity of the people, which means that they do not \\n',\n 'need to divide into groups, and that the populists hold a monopoly on legit-\\n',\n 'imate representation as the only true voice of the people. When populists \\n',\n 'come to power, they seek to close off the political process in order to root \\n',\n 'out traditional elites from key institutions and then prevent their return to \\n',\n 'power. They are able to legitimate this closure by pointing to the strong \\n',\n 'mandate they have received from the ‘true people’ they claim to represent. \\n',\n 'Hence, scholars such as Jan Zielonka look at efforts to shift from representa-\\n',\n 'tive to plebiscitary democracy, principally through the use of referendums \\n',\n 'but also via periodic assessments of what the people ‘want’ through ‘lis-\\n',\n 'tening tours’, rallies and online voting. They also look at efforts to engage \\n',\n 'in constitutional reforms intended to restrict political competition, tighten \\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What Scholarship Tells Us  |  13 \\n',\n 'political control over the media or upset the constitutional balance of \\n',\n 'power.13 These things are not essentially ‘populist’ given the definition used \\n',\n 'in coding exercises, but they are linked to the notion of populism by affinity \\n',\n 'and implication. Moreover, one can see these efforts both in the European \\n',\n 'context – where the current governments of Hungary and Poland are the \\n',\n 'clearest examples – and in other countries.\\n',\n 'The same can be said about the growing disillusionment with multilat-\\n',\n 'eral institutions, such as the EU or the World Trade Organization, and the \\n',\n 'increasing assault on non-majoritarian institutions such as central banks. \\n',\n 'These are institutional arrangements that politicians across Europe have \\n',\n 'used to remove contentious issues from democratic politics. In doing so, \\n',\n 'however, those same politicians created the impression that these institu-\\n',\n 'tions were beyond democratic accountability.14 Now a growing chorus of \\n',\n 'voices is calling for such institutions to be subject to greater political over-\\n',\n 'sight. The Leave campaign’s emphasis on ‘taking back control’ during the \\n',\n 'British referendum campaign on membership in the EU was an extreme \\n',\n 'form of this argument, as was the complaint made by supporters of this \\n',\n 'campaign (both inside and outside the Conservative government) that the \\n',\n 'Bank of England had somehow tried to interfere in the democratic process \\n',\n 'by publishing estimates of the high costs in terms of output and income of \\n',\n 'leaving the EU.15\\n',\n 'How did Europe come to where it is today?\\n',\n 'One question scholars are asking about this broad array of changes is why \\n',\n 'they are all happening at once. The temptation is to look for broad causal \\n',\n 'mechanisms, such as industrialisation, globalisation, the economic and \\n',\n 'financial crisis, or migration. Industrialisation brought a rise in prosperity \\n',\n 'that changed social values and so unmoored the electorate from more tra-\\n',\n 'ditional political parties; it also created and then transformed the working \\n',\n 'class in ways that strengthened and then fractured the left of the political \\n',\n 'spectrum. Along the way, globalisation created winners and losers without \\n',\n 'ensuring that those who lost out were remembered by political elites. The \\n',\n 'economic and financial crisis confronted policymakers with problems for \\n',\n 'which they lacked solutions, further reducing trust in traditional political \\n',\n '14  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'parties while at the same time widening economic and social inequalities. \\n',\n 'Finally, the migration crisis that started shortly after the Arab Spring trig-\\n',\n 'gered a deep sense of insecurity among voters even as it made them more \\n',\n 'susceptible to the lure of identity politics.16 \\n',\n 'The story of industrialisation is one with deep roots in the literature on \\n',\n 'comparative politics going back to the ‘end of ideology’ debates in the late \\n',\n '1950s and extending through the debate about value change and political \\n',\n 'dealignment up to more current conversations about the impact of mod-\\n',\n 'ernisation and post-modernism. The basic idea is that modern politics, and \\n',\n 'hence modern political parties, emerged alongside the traditional divi-\\n',\n 'sion between labour and capital to form a stable competition between left \\n',\n 'and right – stable so long as competition between these two groups was \\n',\n 'predominant. As industrialisation raised standards of living, however, com-\\n',\n 'petition between labour and capital became less important. The ideological \\n',\n 'hold of traditional political parties over their voters became less powerful \\n',\n 'as a consequence.17\\n',\n 'The impact of this weakening of traditional political ideologies was \\n',\n 'not immediately obvious. To be sure, the 1960s and 1970s were a turbu-\\n',\n 'lent period. Nevertheless, the record of electoral data does not support the \\n',\n 'idea that voters suddenly liberated themselves from established parties and \\n',\n 'hence became available for populist political mobilisation in those years. \\n',\n 'Indeed, the most important statistical work done in the 1980s suggested \\n',\n 'that European party systems had stabilised despite the tumult in the streets. \\n',\n 'This supported the paradoxical notion that a weakening of the salience of \\n',\n 'ideological competition might coincide with the stabilisation of political \\n',\n 'identities rather than with their dissolution.18\\n',\n 'That paradoxical conclusion proved to be premature, probably because \\n',\n 'the change in political behaviour had not yet made its way into the voting \\n',\n 'data. Here it is useful to recall from Norris and Inglehart that the big jump in \\n',\n 'the support for populist parties across Europe took place between the 1970s \\n',\n 'and the 1980s19 – a period which falls at the end of the long-term statisti-\\n',\n 'cal analysis done by Stefano Bartolini and Peter Mair in their classic work, \\n',\n 'Identity, Competition and Electoral Availability.20 That transformation was, \\n',\n 'however, captured in public-opinion polling. In previous work, Inglehart \\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What Scholarship Tells Us  |  15 \\n',\n 'demonstrated that the spread of industrial development and associated rel-\\n',\n 'ative economic prosperity had a transformative impact, both over time and \\n',\n 'across countries, on the underlying structure of political and social values, \\n',\n 'undermining the authority of traditional political institutions and nurtur-\\n',\n 'ing new patterns of political involvement within the electorate.21 Bartolini \\n',\n 'and Mair amended their analysis of the development of European poli-\\n',\n 'tics to show how European voters lost their traditional political identities \\n',\n 'and party affiliations in ever greater numbers over time. In doing so, they \\n',\n 'allowed for the possibility that new political movements would emerge to \\n',\n 'challenge the predominance of the mainstream political parties.22\\n',\n 'The globalisation argument, which runs \\n',\n 'alongside the industrialisation argument, has \\n',\n 'grown in prominence with the rise of China \\n',\n 'in the 1990s and 2000s, and with the rapid \\n',\n 'growth of migration from the Islamic world \\n',\n 'into Europe prior to the global economic and \\n',\n 'financial crisis. These issues – industrialisation, \\n',\n 'trade, migration – are interconnected in complex ways. Barry Eichengreen \\n',\n 'offers perhaps the most comprehensive account in The Populist Temptation, \\n',\n 'in which he argues that any shift from relative economic autonomy to \\n',\n 'a more complex division of labour – whether from self-sufficient towns \\n',\n 'to larger national markets, or from self-sufficient countries to a global \\n',\n 'economy – causes economic hardship and hence resentment. Such shifts \\n',\n 'also tend to coincide with changes in communication technology that \\n',\n 'make it easier for new voices to participate in political life. Thus, major \\n',\n 'economic transformations tend to correlate with major challenges to the \\n',\n 'existing political order. That we would see a rise in populist political \\n',\n 'parties alongside a major acceleration in the globalisation of economic \\n',\n 'activity is part of a larger pattern in that sense.23 \\n',\n 'The changes seen at the outset of the twenty-first century are different \\n',\n 'both in terms of scale and of intensity. The integration of the global economy \\n',\n 'fostered a huge movement of people, which is where the scale of this process \\n',\n 'becomes important. The challenge for Europe as an early beneficiary of the \\n',\n 'globalisation process has been to accommodate large inflows of migrants \\n',\n 'European voters \\n',\n 'lost their traditional \\n',\n 'political identities\\n',\n '16  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'from less developed parts of the globe. These new immigrants often came \\n',\n 'from very different cultural backgrounds, and many had difficulty assimi-\\n',\n 'lating European cultural norms. This resulted, by the late 1990s and early \\n',\n '2000s, in a strong backlash from those Europeans who perceived a threat \\n',\n 'to their local or national cultures. Often, these were the same Europeans \\n',\n 'who had experienced the greatest hardship from changes in their country’s \\n',\n 'own economic patterns. Such hardship may or may not have been directly \\n',\n 'connected to the inflow of new migrants – that link is the subject of active con-\\n',\n 'troversy among economists and political scientists. What matters in political \\n',\n 'terms is that the two situations – migration and economic dislocation – have \\n',\n 'been connected both by prominent analysts and by political challengers – \\n',\n 'such as Jörg Haider in Austria and Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands24 – who \\n',\n 'have sought to pull support from the mainstream political parties.25 \\n',\n 'The intensification of trade and migration within Europe has been \\n',\n 'another important source of economic and political adjustment both within \\n',\n 'individual countries and across the continent.26 The (re)integration of post-\\n',\n 'communist Europe into the wider European economy has resulted in a \\n',\n 'significant shift in the location of economic activity from West to East and \\n',\n 'from rural to urban areas. Urban centres have largely benefited across the \\n',\n 'continent; smaller communities and rural areas have lost out. This large–\\n',\n 'small, urban–rural division has disrupted the geographic pattern of political \\n',\n 'competition within European countries. Whereas European politics used \\n',\n 'to be defined by ‘frozen’ cleavages, among which the urban–rural divide \\n',\n 'played a role in reinforcing party identification, divergence in conditions \\n',\n 'across urban and rural electors worked to undermine voter identification \\n',\n 'with traditional parties. This happened first as voters in rural areas and \\n',\n 'smaller communities felt ignored and so pulled away from the mainstream \\n',\n 'political parties (which seemed largely ignorant of, or indifferent to, the \\n',\n 'problems these voters faced), and then as new challenger parties arose that \\n',\n 'promised to address local concerns and protect local political identities.27 \\n',\n 'The remarkable success of the UK Independence Party in traditional Labour \\n',\n 'heartlands in the north of England is a good illustration; the success of \\n',\n 'Italy’s Five Star Movement (M5S) in the traditionally Christian Democratic \\n',\n 'strongholds of the Italian south is another.\\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What Scholarship Tells Us  |  17 \\n',\n 'The onset of the global financial crisis added a new dimension to the \\n',\n 'problems facing mainstream European political parties by reinforcing the \\n',\n 'perception that many of Europe’s frontbench politicians are incompetent, \\n',\n 'indifferent or corrupt. The charge of incompetence stems from the handling \\n',\n 'of the crisis. This is a big and complex argument that is difficult to sum-\\n',\n 'marise, but Adam Tooze makes a worthy attempt in his book Crashed, in \\n',\n 'which he argues that no one benefited from the way European policymakers \\n',\n 'have responded to the global economic and financial crisis, and so everyone \\n',\n 'can find grievances in how the crisis was managed. ‘The loss of credibility is \\n',\n 'flagrant, and it is comprehensive’, he writes.28 He identifies the mainstream \\n',\n 'political parties as the biggest losers: \\n',\n 'Since 2007 the scale of the financial crisis has placed [the] relationship \\n',\n 'between democratic politics and the demands of capitalist governance \\n',\n 'under immense strain. Above all, that strain has manifested itself not \\n',\n 'in a crisis of popular participation, or the ultimate control of policy by \\n',\n 'elected leaders, but in a crisis in the political parties that have historically \\n',\n 'mediated the two.29\\n',\n 'The charge of indifference stems from the delegation of authority to \\n',\n 'non-majoritarian institutions, both domestically and at the international \\n',\n 'level. Wolfgang Streeck is the most compelling advocate of this position.30 \\n',\n 'The essence of Streeck’s argument in How Will Capitalism End? is that if a \\n',\n 'liberal market economy can only be managed if key policy positions are \\n',\n 'held outside the democratic process, then capitalism may have to surren-\\n',\n 'der to the need for political accountability. The problem is not that these \\n',\n 'institutions are necessarily ineffective; it is that they are perceived to be \\n',\n 'irresponsive. That irresponsiveness, in turn, has tended to undermine their \\n',\n 'legitimacy. Here it is worth noting that even high-level policymakers such \\n',\n 'as Paul Tucker, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, have \\n',\n 'accepted the logic behind the argument.31\\n',\n 'The charge of corruption stems from the close relationship between \\n',\n 'central banks and financial institutions. This problem runs deeper than the \\n',\n 'political independence that central banks possess as monetary policymakers, \\n',\n '18  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'touching on the crucial role they play in stabilising the financial system. The \\n',\n 'problem is that too many banks, both in Europe and in the United States, \\n',\n 'were either too big to fail or too connected to fail. Moreover, politicians \\n',\n 'sought to escape responsibility for the fragility of the financial system \\n',\n '(which is primarily a function of financial regulation) and for the inevitable \\n',\n 'bailout of key financial institutions. This created the widespread impression \\n',\n 'that banks enjoyed an exorbitant privilege during the recent economic and \\n',\n 'financial crisis that ordinary households and taxpayers did not.32\\n',\n 'Finally, the European migration crisis created a new dynamic that \\n',\n 'tended to favour both the political right and more authoritarian forms of \\n',\n 'government. The impact of migration on local voting patterns has already \\n',\n 'been noted.33 This was only reinforced by the surge of migration from \\n',\n 'across the Mediterranean following the political transformation of the Arab \\n',\n 'world in 2011. In After Europe, Ivan Krastev argues that the sudden wave \\n',\n 'of migrants and refugees both undermined the prospects for European \\n',\n 'solidarity (or any vision of European unity) and reinforced national iden-\\n',\n 'tities, particularly to the benefit of more extremist parties. The result has \\n',\n 'been to transform European ‘democracy from an instrument for inclusion \\n',\n 'to an instrument of exclusion’.34\\n',\n 'All this suggests that the rise of populism and the decline of main-\\n',\n 'stream political parties have many different and reinforcing origins. By \\n',\n 'implication, these are not trends that will be easily reversed, either in \\n',\n 'terms of the structure of European politics or its style.35 Still, most analysts \\n',\n 'are unwilling to predict the collapse of liberal democracy altogether. Even \\n',\n 'those books with the most dramatic titles conclude on relatively optimistic \\n',\n 'notes. Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt argue in How Democracies Die, \\n',\n 'for instance, that a potential solution to contemporary political problems \\n',\n 'would be to build a more just society, particularly in terms of the distri-\\n',\n 'bution of income; while David Runciman, author of How Democracy Ends, \\n',\n 'seems to conclude that the solution is to lower expectations of democratic \\n',\n 'performance.36 Neither book urges complacency, and both argue that \\n',\n 'democracy is the best way to promote human dignity. If they are right, \\n',\n 'then in keeping with Eichengreen’s historical analysis, this may be just \\n',\n 'another phase in European political development.37\\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What Scholarship Tells Us  |  19 \\n',\n 'What are the implications of this transformation?\\n',\n 'Many analysts have focused on the question of what the implications of this \\n',\n 'historical period will be for the functioning of existing political institutions. \\n',\n 'Their arguments point in many different directions, ranging from changes \\n',\n 'in underlying norms and conventions to identity policies, political discourse \\n',\n 'and constitutional arrangements. Scholars also look at popular attitudes \\n',\n 'toward the role of science in policymaking, at support for multilateralism \\n',\n 'beyond the nation-state and at the possibility of some kind of fundamental \\n',\n 'change in the way the EU is structured. While these implications fall short of \\n',\n 'an existential threat to democracy, they are important nonetheless.\\n',\n 'At a very basic level, the rise of populist political parties will usher \\n',\n 'in a higher level of tension and conflict. As Runciman explains: ‘democ-\\n',\n 'racy is civil war without the fighting. Failure comes when proxy battles \\n',\n 'turn into real ones.’38 Yet for democracy to work, participants must trust in \\n',\n 'democratic institutions to handle conflicts in a just and equitable manner, \\n',\n 'a requirement that is at odds with the populist notion of democracy as the \\n',\n 'expression of the unified will of the one true people. Indeed, populist polit-\\n',\n 'ical challengers tend to be deeply intolerant of pluralism. As a result, they \\n',\n 'also tend to be intolerant of political norms that reinforce comity and col-\\n',\n 'legiality. Such norms are important because they underpin constitutional \\n',\n 'arrangements. Levitsky and Ziblatt make the argument that no written \\n',\n 'constitution can be complete, and that constitutional arrangements cannot \\n',\n 'function properly if there is no desire among political actors that they do \\n',\n 'so. By undermining basic norms, therefore, populist political challengers \\n',\n 'lower the effectiveness of existing constitutional arrangements. In turn, \\n',\n 'both political conflict and institutional ineffectiveness tend to undermine \\n',\n 'confidence in democratic institutions.39 \\n',\n 'The weakening of democratic norms coincides with the strengthening \\n',\n 'of political identities, both positive and negative. Supporters of populist \\n',\n 'parties identify themselves ever more forcefully as the ‘true people’ and \\n',\n 'characterise opponents as either corrupt elites or dangerous outsiders. For \\n',\n 'their part, opponents of populist parties characterise their adherents as \\n',\n 'insular and retrograde. This emphasis on identity politics tends to lead not \\n',\n 'only to conflict but to polarisation, fear and exclusion.40 These identities are \\n',\n '20  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'imposed as often as they are chosen. As Kwame Anthony Appiah explains \\n',\n 'in The Lies That Bind: ‘not only does your identity give you reasons to do \\n',\n 'things, it can give others reasons to do things to you … [A]mong the most \\n',\n 'significant things people do with identities is use them as the basis of hier-\\n',\n 'archies of states and respect and of structures of power.’41 \\n',\n 'Democratic societies are able to overcome such dynamics, but only with \\n',\n 'considerable effort and understanding. Critics of multiculturalism argue \\n',\n 'that the problems in evidence today are a consequence of the excessively \\n',\n 'liberal policies of the past rather than the politics of the present.42 Whatever \\n',\n 'its origins, European populism may leave a lasting impression on social \\n',\n 'relationships. It has already changed political discourse in ways that allow \\n',\n 'greater scope for exclusionary language.\\n',\n 'This shift in language is not limited to identity politics. Populist political \\n',\n 'challengers also have a distinctive relationship with ‘truth’. This is the argu-\\n',\n 'ment that Catherine Fieschi makes in Populocracy. Drawing on a long and \\n',\n 'detailed analysis of the French National Front (now called National Rally), \\n',\n 'Fieschi shows how the party’s political leaders have openly spread false-\\n',\n 'hoods, both to challenge conventional speech norms and to provoke conflict, \\n',\n 'with little impact on their own credibility. Fieschi argues that credibility has \\n',\n 'less to do with ‘truth’ and more to do with ‘authenticity’. Supporters do not \\n',\n 'have to believe everything that the leadership says – they just have to trust \\n',\n 'that the leadership will remain true to itself.43 As Krastev explains: ‘what \\n',\n 'populists promise their voters is not competence but intimacy’.44 \\n',\n 'Yet any political discourse that undermines truth will also challenge \\n',\n 'the status of expertise.45 Hence another implication of the rise of populism \\n',\n 'is the declining use of science in policymaking. This is the central claim \\n',\n 'made by Tom Nichols in The Death of Expertise. Nichols’s concern is not \\n',\n 'only that politicians will degrade the status of experts, but also that the \\n',\n 'result will be less effective policymaking, resulting in a kind of ‘death spiral \\n',\n 'that presents an immediate danger of decay either into rule by the mob or \\n',\n 'toward elitist technocracy’.46 Alternatively, public policy will be captured \\n',\n 'by ‘thought leaders’ in the pay of powerful, monied interests. In this \\n',\n 'version of the argument, the rise of populism runs alongside the failures \\n',\n 'of the ‘marketplace of ideas’ insofar as populists tend to misunderstand \\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What Scholarship Tells Us  |  21 \\n',\n 'the world of ideas and overestimate the possibility of living without ideas \\n',\n 'or expertise. Ironically, therefore, populists make it easier for monied \\n',\n 'interests to dominate ‘thought leadership’.47\\n',\n 'A further implication of the rise of populism is the weakening of politi-\\n',\n 'cal institutions. Populist governments can weaken existing institutions in \\n',\n 'two different ways. Firstly, they can staff public institutions with people \\n',\n 'who are either incompetent or uninterested in actual policy. Reflecting \\n',\n 'on the Trump administration in his book The Fifth Risk, Michael Lewis \\n',\n 'describes this as ‘people risk’.48 Alternatively, populist political movements \\n',\n 'can attempt to change their country’s constitutional arrangements to make \\n',\n 'them less pluralistic. As Krastev explains: ‘popu-\\n',\n 'list and radical parties aren’t just parties; they are \\n',\n 'constitutional movements. They promise voters \\n',\n 'what liberal democracy cannot: a sense of victory \\n',\n 'where majorities – not just political majorities, but \\n',\n 'ethnic and religious majorities – can do what they \\n',\n 'please.’49 These possibilities are manifest not only \\n',\n 'in countries such as Hungary and Poland, where the governments have a \\n',\n 'clear constitutional agenda, but also in countries such as Austria and Italy, \\n',\n 'where populist political movements have the power to impose their per-\\n',\n 'sonnel on public institutions with relatively few constitutional checks and \\n',\n 'balances. The point to note is that this problem runs alongside the natural \\n',\n 'inclination of populist parties to seek to remove traditional elites from \\n',\n 'power and to emphasise the mandate they hold from the ‘true people’ they \\n',\n 'claim to represent.\\n',\n 'The implications of the rise of populism for the European project are \\n',\n 'perhaps even more important. Mair has noted that there is a close connec-\\n',\n 'tion between popular attitudes toward domestic political elites and popular \\n',\n 'attitudes toward European institutions.50 The strength of that connection \\n',\n 'derives from the long history of European integration as an elite project. \\n',\n 'Moreover, the link continues to show up in public-opinion polling, even at \\n',\n 'the local level.51 The constitutional structure of the EU further strengthens \\n',\n 'this connection by confusing lines of accountability and areas of competence. \\n',\n 'Both Fabbrini and Zielonka make this point in different ways. Fabbrini leans \\n',\n 'Populists tend to \\n',\n 'misunderstand \\n',\n 'the world of ideas\\n',\n '22  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'toward the claim that the failure of Europe is fostering populism within \\n',\n 'EU member states, while Zielonka leans toward the view that the popular \\n',\n 'revolt against domestic elites is weakening support for European integra-\\n',\n 'tion. The two dynamics could operate simultaneously.52 There is no obvious \\n',\n 'way to resolve the inevitable tension.\\n',\n 'A new wave of scholarship is attempting to theorise the possibility \\n',\n 'of European disintegration. Hans Vollaard, in his recent book European \\n',\n 'Disintegration, shows how the transformation of domestic politics and \\n',\n 'the progressive dysfunction of European institutions are closely intercon-\\n',\n 'nected.53 It would be a stretch to say that all of Europe’s problems derive \\n',\n 'from the rise of populist political movements; the point is simply that the \\n',\n 'transformation of European integration is closely connected to the drivers \\n',\n 'of populism.\\n',\n 'Three illustrations of developments under way\\n',\n 'There is a danger that any discussion of populism can become too open-\\n',\n 'ended. Populism is not the sole challenge facing European democracies, even \\n',\n 'as it exerts a powerful influence on democratic performance. Therefore, it is \\n',\n 'useful to try to ground the discussion in concrete examples of cases where \\n',\n 'populism has had an influence. The most obvious illustrations can be found \\n',\n 'in the United Kingdom and Italy. The situation in Poland and Hungary is \\n',\n 'more confusing: the governments of both countries are engaged in constitu-\\n',\n 'tional efforts that display significant authoritarian tendencies, and yet it is \\n',\n 'difficult to see the political leadership of either country as somehow outside \\n',\n 'the political establishment. They may have been ‘populist’ at one time, but \\n',\n 'they now constitute the political mainstream. This may be a preview of the \\n',\n 'longer-term implications of the rise of European populism.\\n',\n 'The British case is interesting because it shows the influence of populist \\n',\n 'political movements operating outside the government. The events leading \\n',\n 'up to the UK’s EU referendum have been ably detailed by journalists and \\n',\n 'insiders.54 That story demonstrates just how easily populist political pres-\\n',\n 'sure can shift the policy agenda; it also shows how challenging it is for \\n',\n 'mainstream politicians to push back against disinformation by relying on \\n',\n '‘expertise’. In Brexit and British Politics, Geoffrey Evans and Anand Menon \\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What Scholarship Tells Us  |  23 \\n',\n 'explain why the referendum result went against the government, and what \\n',\n 'it means for British politics. In the process, they do an excellent job of reveal-\\n',\n 'ing the underlying social and political trends. British politics has changed \\n',\n 'fundamentally in the sense that society is now deeply polarised and the \\n',\n 'electorate more volatile, and the ‘socially liberal, pro-market consensus that \\n',\n 'dominated UK politics for the last four decades’ has ended.55 The United \\n',\n 'Kingdom is now a very different country than it was before the referendum \\n',\n 'took place.\\n',\n 'Italy has also changed. What distinguishes the Italian case, however, is \\n',\n 'that the country’s politics is dominated by the two varieties of populism \\n',\n 'embodied by M5S and Lega. Here it is useful to recall Fabbrini’s distinction \\n',\n 'between populist nationalism and nationalist populism. M5S represents a \\n',\n 'revolt of urban youth against a system they believe to be corrupt and unmer-\\n',\n 'itocratic.56 Lega is a right-wing political movement that blends appeals to \\n',\n 'traditional family values with a promise to uphold the economic interests \\n',\n 'of the entrepreneurial class.57 Lega also has deep ties to Italy’s fascist tradi-\\n',\n 'tions, ties that have become even stronger as Lega leader Matteo Salvini has \\n',\n 'worked to transform the northern separatist movement into a true national \\n',\n 'party by absorbing the older support base of the National Alliance (which \\n',\n 'sprung from the Italian Social Movement) and the more anti-communist \\n',\n 'elements of Silvio Berlusconi’s party. Originally, most Italians believed that \\n',\n 'the M5S and Lega would be incompatible, given that they have very differ-\\n',\n 'ent constituencies, both demographically and geographically. In the March \\n',\n '2018 parliamentary elections, M5S drew votes nationally but concentrated \\n',\n 'its support in the south, while Lega drew votes primarily from the north. It \\n',\n 'was not at all clear how these different strains of populism would interact, \\n',\n 'or whether a coalition of these forces would prove to be stable.58 \\n',\n 'The constitutional changes brought about by the governments of Hungary \\n',\n 'and Poland constitute a third interesting case, of which one distinguishing \\n',\n 'feature is the degree to which the governments of both countries have sought \\n',\n 'to concentrate power and eliminate checks and balances. This emphasis \\n',\n 'on challenging existing constitutional arrangements is consistent with the \\n',\n 'arguments made by Krastev, and is a recurrent theme in Mudde’s political \\n',\n 'commentary.59 The challenge is to assess how much of this transformation \\n',\n '24  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'is anti-democratic or anti-pluralist, and how much is a function of a \\n',\n 'long-running struggle against the institutional and political legacies of \\n',\n 'communism.60 What is interesting to note, however, is how differently \\n',\n 'the two countries have been treated by politicians elsewhere in Europe. \\n',\n 'R. Daniel Kelemen argues that the Hungarian government has benefited \\n',\n 'from the political shelter provided by the European People’s Party, while \\n',\n 'the Polish government has had fewer powerful allies. In this way, these two \\n',\n 'countries reveal the complicated relationship between European politics \\n',\n 'and national politics. The EU has proven to be less of a staunch advocate of \\n',\n 'democratic liberalism than many analysts might presume.61\\n',\n 'Lessons to be learned and avenues for further study\\n',\n 'There is no easy conclusion to draw from these three vignettes. It would be \\n',\n 'tempting to foresee the end of Europe as Krastev does, or the end of democ-\\n',\n 'racy as Levitsky and Ziblatt do, but a close reading of their books (and \\n',\n 'others like them) does not point to that conclusion – nor does it suggest a \\n',\n 'readiness on the part of the authors to embrace the full implications of their \\n',\n 'titles.62 Europe is undergoing a transformation and populism is playing a \\n',\n 'significant role in that process, but it is unclear where that transformation \\n',\n 'is headed. \\n',\n 'Eichengreen may be right that what we are seeing – the increasing polari-\\n',\n 'sation of politics, the fragmentation of representative assemblies and so on \\n',\n '– is just another stage in Europe’s political development. If he is right, then \\n',\n 'European democracies can be expected to survive the challenges they are \\n',\n 'facing.63 The only question is how much institutional damage, in the form \\n',\n 'of poor policymaking and misguided institutional reforms, they will experi-\\n',\n 'ence in the meantime. Lasting social divisions could be a problem as well. \\n',\n 'These symptoms will play out differently from one country to the next, but \\n',\n 'their impact on the European project will affect all European democracies.\\n',\n 'A question that needs more careful study is how long the current phase \\n',\n 'of electoral volatility and parliamentary fragmentation can persist. Most \\n',\n 'European constitutional arrangements are ill-suited to support minority \\n',\n 'governments or weak executives. At the same time, constitutions are hard \\n',\n 'to change without supermajorities. Hence the danger is not that Europe \\n',\n 'Populism in Europe: What Scholarship Tells Us  |  25 \\n',\n 'will succumb to populism but rather that European political institutions \\n',\n 'will decline into ineffectiveness – until a group that is strong enough to \\n',\n 'command a supermajority finds a way to change them. \\n',\n 'It is useful when considering the weakening of national political institu-\\n',\n 'tions over time to distinguish between popular attitudes toward national \\n',\n 'democracy and popular attitudes toward the EU. Europeans learned from \\n',\n 'the EU’s constitutional debate in the early 2000s that it is not enough to \\n',\n 'express support for European integration in general; Europeans must \\n',\n 'support the same conception of Europe for the project to flourish.64 Where \\n',\n 'national interpretations of the European project differ – and where national \\n',\n 'political dynamics complicate efforts to accommodate differences from one \\n',\n 'country to the next – the EU tends to falter. \\n',\n 'The current tension in the Franco-German relationship is a good illustra-\\n',\n 'tion of this dynamic at work; the role played by the Netherlands as spoiler \\n',\n 'in the debate about European macroeconomic governance reform is an even \\n',\n 'better one. The French government has pushed hard for the EU to provide \\n',\n 'some form of common fiscal resources either to backstop national unemploy-\\n',\n 'ment insurance or to engage in a more ambitious form of macroeconomic \\n',\n 'stabilisation for countries that move outside the European business cycle. \\n',\n 'By contrast, the German government has resisted any new fiscal-transfer \\n',\n 'mechanism and has even begun to row back on commitments to complete \\n',\n 'the European banking union with common resolution financing or deposit \\n',\n 'insurance. The French want a Europe of solidarity; the Germans are more \\n',\n 'eager to see a Europe of national responsibility. Within this division, the \\n',\n 'Dutch have staked out a position that is even less generous and more self-\\n',\n 'reliant than the German one – and it has gathered a number of smaller \\n',\n 'member states in a new Hanseatic League to add weight to its determina-\\n',\n 'tion to resist any efforts to use European institutions to move money from \\n',\n 'one member state to the next. Hence a third question that requires further \\n',\n 'research is whether the evolution of national politics in Europe is placing \\n',\n 'ever tighter constraints on what European integration can accomplish.\\n',\n 'A final topic that warrants research attention is the impact of the rise of \\n',\n 'populism on the transatlantic relationship and on the conduct of US foreign \\n',\n 'policy. Given that populist parties differ in their ideological commitments, \\n',\n '26  |  Erik Jones\\n',\n 'it is tempting to ask whether some parties will prove more amenable to \\n',\n 'a strong transatlantic partnership than others. This is one area where the \\n',\n 'narrow definition of populism is helpful. A common theme running through \\n',\n 'the literature is the importance of ‘the people’, a feature that has implica-\\n',\n 'tions for attitudes toward national sovereignty. In countries where populist \\n',\n 'parties pose a credible threat to traditional elites, we should expect those \\n',\n 'elites to make more strenuous efforts to demonstrate that they are defending \\n',\n 'the national interest.65 Where populist parties are in government, this defence \\n',\n 'of the national interest becomes even more vigorous and idiosyncratic. Here \\n',\n 'the best illustrations centre on the implausible alliance that appears to be \\n',\n 'developing between the governments of Italy, Hungary and Poland.\\n',\n 'Such developments pose an array of challenges for the conduct of US \\n',\n 'foreign policy because they call into question the durability of multilateral \\n',\n 'institutions and the credibility of bilateral commitments. The full extent \\n',\n 'of this change requires deeper exploration. The point to note, however, is \\n',\n 'that the difficulties created by populist political dynamics in Europe are not \\n',\n 'limited to the ideological commitments of any given political party. Should \\n',\n 'the Greens come to power in Germany, for example, we should expect them \\n',\n 'to push their conception of the national interest and not to sacrifice their \\n',\n 'view of what is right for the Germans on the altar of some greater project. \\n',\n 'They may be pro-European, but they have a very specific understanding of \\n',\n 'what the EU is meant to accomplish, and they are not supportive of other \\n',\n 'interpretations. The surprisingly vigorous politicisation of the Transatlantic \\n',\n 'Trade and Investment Partnership illustrates the constraints that this type \\n',\n 'of populism can place on international cooperation. The bottom line is that \\n',\n 'European politics is becoming more difficult for US policymakers to navi-\\n',\n 'gate. More research is required to map the obstacles.\\n',\n 'Notes\\n',\n '1 \\n',\n 'This survey is at least partly the result \\n',\n 'of my work as a contributing editor to \\n',\n 'Survival.
