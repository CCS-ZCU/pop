A plea for both\\n',\n 'more and less focus\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n 'Department of Political Science, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands\\n',\n 'Abstract. As a result of the steady rise of populist parties and politicians all over the world – and particularly\\n',\n 'since the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump – populism research has become increasingly\\n',\n 'popular and widespread. The field, however, also faces some tricky challenges. First, it is easy to confuse\\n',\n 'populism with related concepts like, for instance, ‘nativism’ and ‘Euroscepticism’. This brings the risk of\\n',\n 'sloppy conceptualisation, and, as a result, invalid inferences. Second, populism research remains relatively\\n',\n 'detached from adjacent fields,and fruitful fertilisation across literatures is still rather uncommon.In order to\\n',\n 'deal with these challenges,populism research should become both more and less focused.How can these two\\n',\n 'seemingly conflicting recommendations be reconciled? When it comes to conceptualisation/categorisation\\n',\n 'strategies and drawing conclusions from studies by other researchers, populism scholars should employ a\\n',\n 'narrow framework and be precise, distinctive and consistent. Yet when it comes to exploring the literature\\n',\n 'in search of new hypotheses, scholars should employ a more open mind-set. After all, theories developed in\\n',\n 'adjacent fields can inspire populism scholars to formulate innovative new questions and expectations.\\n',\n 'Keyword: populism\\n',\n 'Introduction\\n',\n 'Populism is sexy.Particularly since 2016 – the year of the Brexit referendum and the election\\n',\n 'of Donald Trump – it seems as if journalists just cannot get enough of it. In 2015, The New\\n',\n 'York Times used the terms ‘populism’ or ‘populist’ 671 times. One year later, that number\\n',\n 'had doubled to 1,399. And in 2017, the newspaper employed these words 2,537 times. It\\n',\n 'is therefore unremarkable that in 2017 ‘populism’ was declared word of the year by the\\n',\n 'Cambridge Dictionary. Yet the current allure of the term is not only the result of what\\n',\n 'happened in Britain and the United States; it is the result of the steady rise of populist\\n',\n 'parties and politicians all over the world.\\n',\n 'The increasing appeal of populism is also reflected in academia. Searching the Web of\\n',\n 'Science database reveals that in 2010 ‘only’ 76 articles had been published with the words\\n',\n '‘populism’ or ‘populist’ in the title. In 2015 this number had increased to 155, in 2016 to 208\\n',\n 'and in 2017 to 332. Moreover, an increasing number of conference panels, workshops and\\n',\n 'roundtables are devoted to the topic. There now even is a journal fully devoted to populism!\\n',\n 'It seems safe to conclude that research on populism has become an industry of its own within\\n',\n 'the political science literature.\\n',\n 'In this article I discuss the literature on populism, thereby mainly focusing on the\\n',\n 'books and articles that have emerged in the last decade or so. Of course, given the sheer\\n',\n 'number of recently published studies (see above), I can only refer to a small subsample\\n',\n 'of them here. One of my main aims is to identify lacunas and weaknesses and to provide\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '<image: DeviceRGB, width: 228, height: 45, bpc: 8>HOW TO STUDY POPULISM AND ADJACENT TOPICS?\\n',\n '363\\n',\n 'suggestions for future research. I distinguish two main challenges to the populism literature,\\n',\n 'and provide suggestions for how researchers could deal with them. I conclude by assessing\\n',\n 'what researchers from other fields can learn from populism research, and how (the other\\n',\n 'way around) populism scholars can build on studies on adjacent topics.\\n',\n 'Populism research so far\\n',\n 'Among some academics, the term ‘populism’ had already become attractive half a century\\n',\n 'ago. In 1967, a group of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines came together in London\\n',\n 'to discuss populism – a phenomenon that, according to the editors of the edited volume that\\n',\n 'resulted from this conference, ‘has been more fundamental to the shaping of the political\\n',\n 'mind than is generally acknowledged’ (Ionescu & Gellner 1969:5).The participants strongly\\n',\n 'focused on conceptual issues (what exactly is populism? what are its core characteristics?)\\n',\n 'and descriptions of histories of populism in various countries. The main conclusion was that\\n',\n 'there was no agreement on how to define populism.\\n',\n 'Almost 15 years after the conference, the political theorist Margaret Canovan (1981)\\n',\n 'again underlined the elusiveness of the concept.She compared various instances of populism\\n',\n 'across cases and over time, and made a distinction between seven different types of\\n',\n 'populism. Yet she did not identify a common feature that all these categories of populism\\n',\n 'had in common, and which could be usefully employed in comparative research.\\n',\n 'Until the turn of the millennium, various scholars from different parts of the world –\\n',\n 'mostly Latin America (see Di Tella 1965;Roberts 1995) and the United States (see Goodwyn\\n',\n '1976; Kazin 1995) and to a lesser extent also Europe (see Laclau 1977) – had made various\\n',\n 'important contributions to the populism literature. Yet most of these studies focused on\\n',\n 'specific geographic areas and failed to transcend continental borders.\\n',\n 'The first decade of the 2000s, however, saw a rise of populism studies with a more\\n',\n 'comparative outlook, this time mostly focused on Latin America (see Roberts 2006; De\\n',\n 'la Torre 2010; Weyland 2001) and Europe (see Albertazzi & McDonnell 2008; Mény &\\n',\n 'Surel 2002) (see Taggart 2000 for a more general approach). These more recent studies\\n',\n 'still struggled with conceptual issues. In general, however, they focused more strongly\\n',\n 'than their predecessors on empirical data and assessed instances of populism by means\\n',\n 'of (comparative) case studies. Most of these studies assessed why and how certain parties\\n',\n 'or leaders were populist and considered the question of why populist actors had become\\n',\n 'increasingly successful.\\n',\n 'The last decade or so is characterised by an explosion of populism studies in the form of\\n',\n 'monographs (see Moffitt 2016; Müller 2016; Van Kessel 2015), edited volumes (see Kriesi &\\n',\n 'Pappas 2015; Rovira Kaltwasser et al. 2017; Zaslove & Wolinetz 2018), journal articles (see\\n',\n 'Akkerman et al. 2014; Bonikowski & Gidron 2015; Müller et al. 2017) and working papers\\n',\n '(see Inglehart & Norris 2016;Hawkins et al.2012).In general,new studies differ from earlier\\n',\n 'work on populism in various ways.\\n',\n 'First, scholars agree with each other much more strongly than before on how the term\\n',\n 'should be defined. Although populism is still a highly contested concept, and researchers\\n',\n 'still struggle with conceptual issues, many scholars nowadays agree that it should be defined\\n',\n 'as a set of ideas that concerns the antagonistic relationship between the corrupt elite and\\n',\n 'the virtuous people. As a concept, populism thus consists of at least two sub-dimensions:\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '364\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n 'people-centrism and anti-elitism. Whether scholars define populism as a thin ideology\\n',\n '(Mudde 2004; Stanley 2008), a discourse (Hawkins 2010) or a style (Moffitt 2016), the\\n',\n 'large share of populism scholars endorsing the so-called ‘ideational approach’ agrees that\\n',\n 'populism is a substantive message that should be distinguished from related but different\\n',\n 'phenomena like ‘organisation’ or ‘leadership’. But although this is without any doubt an\\n',\n 'important step forward, much work still needs to be done on what exactly is the genus of\\n',\n 'populism. As a set of ideas, should it be conceived of as a discourse, an ideology or a style?\\n',\n 'Second, and this is most probably due to the fact that scholars increasingly agree on\\n',\n 'how to define the term, the emphasis on conceptualising populism has made place for a\\n',\n 'focus on measuring it. The ideational approach to populism (i.e., the belief that populism\\n',\n 'is a set of ideas) implies that political actors can endorse populism to a lesser or larger\\n',\n 'extent. As a result, various researchers have investigated to what extent political parties and\\n',\n 'politicians express populist messages – mostly by means of quantitative content analysis\\n',\n 'methods. Jagers and Walgrave (2007), for instance, have assessed political party broadcasts,\\n',\n 'Hawkins (2010) political speeches, Rooduijn and Pauwels (2011) election manifestos and\\n',\n 'Engesser et al. (2017) social media messages. Of course, the degree of populism of parties\\n',\n 'and politicians could also be assessed in other ways. Polk et al. (2017), for instance, make use\\n',\n 'of expert surveys (but only focus on anti-elitism), and Stavrakakis et al. (2017) ask survey\\n',\n 'questions to assess how populist politicians are. Yet when it comes to measuring populism,\\n',\n 'a lot of work still needs to be done. What is still rather unclear, for instance, is how exactly\\n',\n 'people-centrism and anti-elitism relate to each other.For instance,should anti-elitism always\\n',\n 'be accompanied by people-centrism in order for populism to be present?\\n',\n 'A third way in which more recent research on populism differs from earlier work is that\\n',\n 'populism studies nowadays also focus on other actors than politicians and parties.In general,\\n',\n 'there has been a shift from the supply side of the political spectrum to the demand side.What\\n',\n 'do voters for populist parties have in common (see Pauwels 2014)? Although we know a\\n',\n 'great deal already when it comes to the electorates of right-wing populist parties, we know\\n',\n 'only very little about those who vote for left-wing populist parties or populist parties in\\n',\n 'general. In addition, a rapidly growing literature assesses public opinion by investigating to\\n',\n 'what extent individual citizens have populist ideas. Hawkins et al. (2012) and Akkerman\\n',\n 'et al. (2014) were among the first to demonstrate that populism can also be measured as\\n',\n 'an attitude among voters.1 Recent studies have built on these findings and investigated how\\n',\n 'to validly measure these attitudes (across cases) and how these attitudes affect vote choice\\n',\n '(Schulz et al. 2017; Spruyt et al. 2016; Van Hauwaert & Van Kessel 2018). In addition to\\n',\n 'focusing on voting behaviour and public opinion, scholars have also begun to investigate\\n',\n 'to what extent voting for populists has psychological roots in personality (Bakker et al.\\n',\n '2016; Fatke 2019) or emotions (Rico et al. 2017). This focus on the demand side leads to\\n',\n 'many new interesting questions and challenges. For instance, it has still not been shown\\n',\n 'convincingly that the populist attitude really differs from other attitudinal constructs like\\n',\n '‘political cynicism’ or ‘external efficacy’. To what extent is the populist attitude not just old\\n',\n 'wine in new bottles?\\n',\n 'Fourth, various important recent contributions to populism research have been made by\\n',\n 'communication scientists (Krämer 2014). As a set of ideas, populism is also widespread in\\n',\n 'mass media (Rooduijn 2014). An important question is whether and to what extent populist\\n',\n 'messages in media affect public opinion (see Aalberg et al. 2017). Recent experimental\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'HOW TO STUDY POPULISM AND ADJACENT TOPICS?\\n',\n '365\\n',\n 'studies, for instance, have shown that the populist set of ideas can exert an effect on\\n',\n 'attitudes of individual citizens (see Hameleers et al. 2017). Such studies form an important\\n',\n 'contribution to the literature because they combine supply- and demand-side variables and\\n',\n 'assess how individual citizens respond to populist messages. Yet a drawback is that the\\n',\n 'ecological validity of such experimental studies often is rather low: do the effects also hold\\n',\n 'in real life, and if so, for how long? An innovative recent study tackles this issue by linking\\n',\n 'content analysis data to panel studies (Müller et al. 2017).\\n',\n 'Fifth, and finally, scholars increasingly assess populism in power. This is, of course, due\\n',\n 'to the fact that in recent years populist parties (at least in Europe) have on average become\\n',\n 'much more experienced with government participation.Only think of Syriza and Anexartitoi\\n',\n 'Ellines (Independent Greeks,ANEL) in Greece,the Fremskrittspartiet (Progress Party,FrP)\\n',\n 'in Norway and the Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs (Freedom Party, FPÖ) in Austria. This\\n',\n 'raises the question to what extent populists are able to actually deliver on their electoral\\n',\n 'promises (Albertazzi & McDonnell 2015). Relatedly, scholars increasingly focus on the\\n',\n 'extent to which populists harm liberal democracy.When it comes to the relationship between\\n',\n 'populism and (liberal) democracy, early studies mainly assessed the theoretical tension\\n',\n 'between the two (Canovan 1981). Recent studies, however, also assess the consequences of\\n',\n 'populism for how democracy actually functions (Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2012; Müller\\n',\n '2016).\\n',\n 'Hence, populism research is booming. Yet the field also faces some tricky challenges.\\n',\n 'Below I present two of these challenges and some recommendations on how scholars could\\n',\n 'deal with them.\\n',\n 'Challenge 1: It is easy to confuse populism with related concepts\\n',\n 'As I have argued in the introduction of this article, populism has become a fancy buzzword.\\n',\n 'This is not strange given that parties and politicians that are generally characterised as\\n',\n 'populist (e.g., Trump, Marine Le Pen (Front National, FN) and Geert Wilders (Partij\\n',\n 'voor de Vrijheid, PVV)) have become increasingly successful in the last decade. Because\\n',\n 'the core message of these parties is that one’s own nation is threatened by Muslims,\\n',\n 'immigrants and other alleged ‘dangerous others’, many journalists and academics have\\n',\n 'come to the conclusion that nationalistic exclusionism is one of the core characteristics of\\n',\n 'populism.\\n',\n 'This conclusion is wrong. It is a consequence of confusing populism with a related (but\\n',\n 'different) phenomenon: nativism (see De Cleen et al. 2018). Nativism is ‘an ideology, which\\n',\n 'holds that states should be inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (“the\\n',\n 'nation”) and that nonnative elements (persons and ideas) are fundamentally threatening\\n',\n 'to the homogenous nation-state’ (Mudde 2007: 19). Where populism concerns the vertical\\n',\n 'relationship between ‘the people’ and ‘the elite’,nativism is about the horizontal antagonism\\n',\n 'between ‘the nation’ and ‘dangerous others’ (see also Bonikowski 2017; Rydgren 2005).\\n',\n 'Conflating populism with nativism is not a minor problem. It could lead to highly flawed\\n',\n 'conclusions.\\n',\n 'Let me give an example. Time and again, studies have shown that citizens who vote for\\n',\n 'European populist parties like FN and FPÖ are lower educated citizens (see Arzheimer\\n',\n '2009; Lubbers et al. 2002). Do these findings legitimise the conclusion that the lower\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '366\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n 'educated are more likely to vote for populists? Certainly not. These studies show that\\n',\n 'the lower educated are more likely to vote for radical right-wing populists – who are also\\n',\n 'nativist – but cannot tell us anything about the relationship between education and voting\\n',\n 'for populists in general. After all, the broader category of ‘populists in general’ also includes\\n',\n 'left-wing populists like Syriza in Greece or Podemos in Spain. Such parties conceive of ‘the\\n',\n 'people’ in a much more inclusionary way, and are not nativist at all. In fact, in many cases\\n',\n 'the lower educated are not more likely to vote for such parties (Rooduijn 2017). Hence, the\\n',\n 'fact that lower educated citizens vote for radical right-wing populist parties has not much to\\n',\n 'do with these parties’ populism. Most likely it is their nativism that makes them attractive\\n',\n 'to lower educated voters.\\n',\n 'To prevent drawing such wrong inferences,it is of the upmost importance to:(1) carefully\\n',\n 'conceptualise populism, building on existing studies, and distinguishing it from related\\n',\n 'concepts; (2) carefully categorise parties (and other actors) based on this conceptualisation;\\n',\n '(3) choose a research design that logically follows from, and is consistent with, the chosen\\n',\n 'conceptualisation and categorisation strategy; and (4) evaluate the research findings of\\n',\n 'others based on these same strict criteria.\\n',\n 'How to do that? Table 1 and 2 in the Online Appendix might help. These tables give an\\n',\n 'overview of various types of parties (populist, far right, far left, Eurosceptic and challenger\\n',\n 'parties) and their definitions, and present an overview of party categorisations based on\\n',\n 'these definitions.(Of course,neither these definitions nor the categorisations are undisputed.\\n',\n 'Yet the definitions are clear, concise, coherent and well-established in the literature, and\\n',\n 'the categorisations logically follow from these conceptualisations.) To give an indication of\\n',\n 'how complicated the patchwork is that these overlapping typologies form, Figure 1 below\\n',\n 'focuses on just two countries: Italy and Greece (see Table 2 in the Online Appendix for the\\n',\n 'full party names).The figure shows that:(1) a populist party need not be a Eurosceptic party\\n',\n '(FI), a far left or right party (FI and M5S) or a challenger party (SYR, FI, ANEL and LN);\\n',\n '<image: DeviceGray, width: 2134, height: 1074, bpc: 8>Figure 1. Some of the main contemporary populist, far left/right, Eurosceptic and challenger parties in Italy\\n',\n 'and Greece (for full party names, see the Online Appendix).\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'HOW TO STUDY POPULISM AND ADJACENT TOPICS?\\n',\n '367\\n',\n '(2) a Eurosceptic party need not be a populist party (KKE and Golden Dawn), a far left\\n',\n 'or right party (M5S) or a challenger party (SYR, ANEL and LN); (3) a far left/right party\\n',\n 'need not be a populist party (SEL and KKE regarding the far left and Golden Dawn vis-à-\\n',\n 'vis the far right), a Eurosceptic party (SEL) or a challenger party (SYR, ANEL, LN); and\\n',\n '(4) a challenger party need not be a populist party (SEL, KKE, Greens, Golden Dawn), a\\n',\n 'Eurosceptic party (SEL and Greens) or a far left or right party (M5S or Greens).\\n',\n 'Figure 1 makes clear that, in order to draw the right conclusions, researchers should be\\n',\n 'very careful regarding conceptualisation, categorisation and research design issues. If the\\n',\n 'main aim is,for instance,to assess to what extent the electoral successes of parties like the FN,\\n',\n 'FPÖ and PVV have had an impact on mainstream parties’ immigration positions, it makes\\n',\n 'much more sense to focus on nativism as a central concept than on populism. After all, it\\n',\n 'is their nativism and not their populism that can be expected to affect mainstream parties’\\n',\n 'immigration positions. In other words: researchers should never emphasise the concept of\\n',\n 'populism just because it is such an appealing term.\\n',\n 'Challenge 2: Populism research remains relatively detached from adjacent fields\\n',\n 'This plea for conceptual and methodological focus does not imply that populism researchers\\n',\n 'should only focus on their ‘own’ field and that the populism literature should become more\\n',\n 'detached from adjacent fields. Quite the contrary. The goal of social science concepts and\\n',\n 'theories is to help us better understand real world phenomena. The main strength of the\\n',\n 'concept of populism is that it helps us understand phenomena like Brexit and Trump.\\n',\n 'After all, the message that the virtuous people are exploited or betrayed by a corrupt\\n',\n 'elite was an indispensable ingredient of the rhetoric of many of the Brexiteers (like, for\\n',\n 'instance, Nigel Farage), and it was an essential element of the election campaign of Donald\\n',\n 'Trump.\\n',\n 'However, it is important to realise that populism was by no means the only element that\\n',\n 'the Brexit and Trump campaigns had in common, and which made them so successful. In\\n',\n 'fact, it was not even the most important one. Arguably, the core driver of both the Brexit\\n',\n 'and Trump vote was nativism (see Mudde 2017: Chapter 21). Although many people voting\\n',\n 'in favour of Brexit and Trump were worried or angry about condescending economic and\\n',\n 'political elites, most of them were particularly worried about immigration and the alleged\\n',\n 'threat that immigrants and their ideas pose for the nation-state. This means that although\\n',\n 'populism helps us understand phenomena like Brexit and Trump, for a full understanding\\n',\n 'of these phenomena it is of essential importance to assess how populism is associated with\\n',\n 'related ideologies and messages like Euroscepticism and nativism.\\n',\n 'Unfortunately, however, fruitful fertilisation across different literatures is still rather\\n',\n 'uncommon. In fact, one of the main problems of contemporary populism research is that\\n',\n 'it remains too detached from adjacent literatures. As a result, we know only relatively\\n',\n 'little about how exactly populism relates to concepts like ‘Euroscepticism’ and ‘nativism’.\\n',\n 'Moreover, it is still rather uncommon for theories and hypotheses in populism research to\\n',\n 'be informed by research in other fields. Take, for instance, the literature on ‘anti-political-\\n',\n 'establishment parties’ (Abedi 2002). These parties\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '368\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n 'draw up a triangular symbolic space by (simultaneously) constructing three actors and\\n',\n 'their relationships:the political class,the people and themselves … .The first represents\\n',\n 'the malicious rogue, the second the innocent victim and the third the redeeming hero.\\n',\n 'While citizens and anti-political-establishment actors live in peace and harmony, their\\n',\n 'relationship with the political establishment is deeply antagonistic.(Schedler 1996:293)\\n',\n 'This description of anti-political-establishment parties is almost equal to how most\\n',\n 'scholars nowadays conceptualise populist parties. The only difference is that populism is\\n',\n 'a more general concept that also includes the antagonistic relationship between ‘the people’\\n',\n 'and other types of elites like,for instance,‘untrustworthy bankers’(economic elites),‘snobby\\n',\n 'intellectuals’ (cultural elites) and ‘fake news spreading journalists’ (media elites).\\n',\n 'Because of the commonalities between these concepts, the literature on anti-political-\\n',\n 'establishment parties can be highly informative for populism research. It has, for\\n',\n 'instance,been shown that anti-political-establishment parties that participate in government\\n',\n 'coalitions experience an ‘additional cost of governing’ (Van Spanje 2011): they lose more\\n',\n 'seats than governing parties lose on average – most likely because their anti-political-\\n',\n 'establishment message is not very compatible with participation in a government coalition,\\n',\n 'together with traditional establishment parties. Although we cannot conclude from these\\n',\n 'findings alone that populist parties will also experience an additional cost of governing –\\n',\n 'there are quite some differences between the parties that are generally categorised as ‘anti-\\n',\n 'political-establishment’ and those that are commonly classified as ‘populist’ – the general\\n',\n 'line of reasoning can be tailored to populist parties and inform interesting new research\\n',\n 'questions and hypotheses. It could, for instance, be expected that the more populist a party’s\\n',\n 'discourse is, the more severely it will be punished by voters after having participated in a\\n',\n 'government coalition. Unfortunately, however, communication between these two strands\\n',\n 'of research has so far remained rather limited.\\n',\n 'Another, more distant, field that only rarely informs populism studies is the one focusing\\n',\n 'on in-group/out-group thinking. Populism is an antagonistic set of ideas dividing the world\\n',\n 'into an in-group (the people) and an out-group (the elite). As such, it could be conceived\\n',\n 'of as a concrete manifestation of the more general predisposition to reduce society to ‘us’\\n',\n 'and ‘them’. According to such a general predisposition, ‘[m]embers of in-groups (until they\\n',\n 'prove otherwise) are assumed to be virtuous: friendly, cooperative, trustworthy, safe, and\\n',\n 'more. Members of out-groups (until they prove otherwise) are assumed to be the opposite:\\n',\n 'unfriendly, uncooperative, unworthy of trust, dangerous, and more’ (Kinder & Kam 2010:\\n',\n '8). There is a vast literature on such in-group/out-group thinking (mostly conducted by\\n',\n 'psychologists and public opinion scholars), and it has quite convincingly been demonstrated\\n',\n 'that attitudes towards various out-groups are related and may in fact reflect a single\\n',\n 'underlying general predisposition (Ekehammar et al. 2004; Zick et al. 2008). Although most\\n',\n 'of these studies so far have assessed nativist attitudes (towards immigrants and other ethnic\\n',\n 'groups), the general logic of contraposing the in-group against the out-group is the same\\n',\n 'when it comes to populism. Therefore, research on in-group/out-group thinking could and\\n',\n 'should become an important source of inspiration for populism scholars (see Schulz et al.\\n',\n '2018).\\n',\n 'Of course, it remains of the upmost importance to keep in mind that populism and\\n',\n 'nativism (and attitudes concerning other in- and out-groups) are different phenomena\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'HOW TO STUDY POPULISM AND ADJACENT TOPICS?\\n',\n '369\\n',\n '(see Challenge 1 above), and should therefore not be conflated conceptually. It is also\\n',\n 'important, however, to realise that there is a lot that they do have in common. Hence, future\\n',\n 'studies might want to look at the extent to which populism and nativism (and other related\\n',\n 'concepts) are related to each other. Both are concrete manifestations of in-group/out-group\\n',\n 'thinking, so it might well be the case that at the individual level the two attitudes reinforce\\n',\n 'each other (see Bonikowski & Zhang 2017).\\n',\n 'The solution for the lack of cross-fertilisation between literatures is relatively easy\\n',\n '(though not so easily implemented): populism scholars (and also researchers focusing on\\n',\n 'adjacent topics) should look beyond ‘their own’ field and adopt a wider framework.Findings\\n',\n 'from studies on topic X can be very relevant and inform hypotheses on topic Y. A wider\\n',\n 'framework might well lead to many new interesting hypotheses as well as better scholarly\\n',\n 'communication across literatures.\\n',\n 'Conclusion and discussion\\n',\n 'The literature on populism has exploded in recent years. Moreover, as a result of the Brexit\\n',\n 'and Trump votes, academic attention to the topic can be expected to grow even further\\n',\n 'in the years to come. In this article, I have provided an overview of populism research\\n',\n 'so far, and I have identified various lacunas and weaknesses. Moreover, I have discussed\\n',\n 'two main challenges for the literature on populism. The first challenge is that it is easy\\n',\n 'to confuse populism with related concepts like ‘nativism’ and ‘Euroscepticism’. This is\\n',\n 'highly problematic because it leads to confusion and increases the risk of drawing invalid\\n',\n 'conclusions.Second,populism research has remained relatively detached from literatures on\\n',\n 'related topics. This is inconvenient because it hampers the development of innovative new\\n',\n 'research questions and hypotheses. To deal with these challenges, I have argued in favour of\\n',\n 'both more and less focus within populism studies. How can these two seemingly conflicting\\n',\n 'recommendations be reconciled?\\n',\n 'When it comes to conceptualising their main concepts,classifying the parties they include\\n',\n 'in their analyses, designing their research and drawing conclusions from studies conducted\\n',\n 'by other researchers, populism scholars should employ a narrow framework and be precise,\\n',\n 'distinctive and consistent. This does not mean, however, that they should only stick to\\n',\n 'populism studies,and turn away from research that assesses related but different phenomena\\n',\n 'like, for instance, nativism and Euroscepticism. Oftentimes the theoretical arguments made\\n',\n 'in such studies can, with only some minor adaptations, be transformed into innovative new\\n',\n 'questions and hypotheses about populism. Hence, when it comes to exploring the literature\\n',\n 'in search for new hypotheses, scholars should employ a more open mind-set.\\n',\n 'Populism research can thus learn a lot from adjacent fields. Scholars of, for instance,\\n',\n 'anti-political-establishment parties have developed theories that can relatively easily be\\n',\n 'transformed into hypotheses about populism. At the same time, adjacent literatures can\\n',\n 'also learn a lot from populism research. In order to fully understand phenomena like\\n',\n 'Euroscepticism, polarisation and the rise of challenger parties, one should have, at the very\\n',\n 'least, a basic understanding of populism.\\n',\n 'Unfortunately, however, it is likely that the problem of conceptual blurriness – and,\\n',\n 'hence, the risk of drawing wrong conclusions – becomes more instead of less acute in the\\n',\n 'years to come.For many scholars the sexiness of populism is an incentive to employ the term\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2018 European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '370\\n',\n 'MATTHIJS ROODUIJN\\n',\n '– even if the real focus is on a different topic.Although this will likely increase the popularity\\n',\n 'of the field even further, in the end it will most probably also lead to more conceptual\\n',\n 'blurriness, sloppy inferences and invalid conclusions.\\n',\n 'Acknowledgments\\n',\n 'I would like to thank Stijn van Kessel, Andrej Zaslove and two anonymous reviewers for\\n',\n 'their useful feedback.Luke March,Andrea Pirro and Paul Taggart have helped to categorise\\n',\n 'the parties in the Online Appendix.
