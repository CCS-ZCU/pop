      "embrace of populism. The party that most boldly advocated a break with \n",
      "economic orthodoxy (Labour) was also the biggest vote loser. \n",
      "Populism can be hard to pin down. As a political mood, it seeks to \n",
      "unite the mass of the people against a privileged minority, and to claim \n",
      "discretionary power for a leader who is said to speak for the people. It \n",
      "cares little for minority rights or checks and balances, as these impede \n",
      "the realization of the popular will. When “leavers” denounced Brussels \n",

      "contenders were populists, albeit of different stripes, then deploying references to “populism” to explain what was going on may have limited \n",

      " 2) Outsiders. Populism is supposed to be disruptive, but Boris Johnson is no “outsider” breaking into a closed circle of political professionals. Born in 1964, a graduate of Eton and a student of classics at \n",
      "Balliol College, Oxford, he was president of the Oxford Union, the \n",

      "United States, such committed supporters can accentuate polarization.\n",
      " 3) Backsliding. This refers to politicians who break the procedural \n",
      "“rules of the game,” whether by flagrant deception, by attempting to \n",
      "“prorogue” (delay the meeting of) Parliament on a misleading pretext, \n",
      "or by refusing to debate opponents during a campaign. As the “sliding” metaphor suggests, such conduct is a matter of degree. Almost \n",
      "any successful democratic politician will test boundaries from time to \n",
      "time. Backers will condone the limit-bending when they like the result, \n",

      "will prove a “system-buster.” Perhaps he will not, given how well the \n",
      "system has served him. \n",

      "voters a reasonably appealing and viable alternative. Despite its surprising performance in the June 2017 election, Jeremy Corbyn’s radicalized \n",
      "and divided Labour Party struggled with this basic task. In the 2019 campaign, things became worse as the party remained officially neutral on \n",

      "voters while retaining the allegiance of older blue-collar “leavers,” but \n",
      "did well in neither effort. \n",
      "By pursuing a strategy that was neither convincing on the key issue \n",

      " with nationalism. Indeed, whereas we might not agree on what is the analytically most powerful definition of\n",
      " populism—mainly a disagreement, we argue, about definitional strategies and levels of abstraction rather than a sub stantive disagreement—our work, like Brubaker's, involves an attempt to arrive at a rigorous definition of populism\n",
      " that can serve as the basis to empirically analyze the complexity, ambiguity, and multi-dimensionality of concrete\n",
      " populisms and their relation to nationalist politics and to the nation-state.\n",
      " In that sense, it should be made clear from the beginning that the difference between our respective arguments\n",
      " is not, as Brubaker suggests, being for (Brubaker) or against (De Cleen and Stavrakakis) impurity and ambiguity.\n",
      " Nothing could be more misleading since we all seem to be determined to stress this dimension. This is evident both\n",
      " in Brubaker's article and in our past work both concerning broader methodological issues (our text on “impurity” is\n",
      " pertinent here; see Stavrakakis 2010) and populism per se (Stavrakakis 2014, p. 506; De Cleen and Stavrakakis\n",
      " 2017). The crucial question is how exactly this ambiguity is to be accurately registered and productively deployed in\n",
      " the analysis of the relations between populism and nationalism. Here, we feel, Brubaker rather exaggerates our posi tion, which cannot be reduced either to ‘excluding' nationalism from populism or to using ‘contingency' to ‘relocate'—\n",
      " and thus minimize—the importance of the ambiguity at stake (Brubaker 2017, pp. 10, 15). On the contrary, we see\n",
      " the acceptance of ‘contingency' as a central epistemological and ontological dimension that forms the condition of\n",
      " possibility for a rigorous awareness of ambiguity itself (Laclau 1990). In addition, what Brubaker sees as exclusion—an\n",
      " ostensibly sharp conceptual distinction between populism and nationalism—follows once more from an ontological\n",
      " toolkit—going back to Saussure—that sees all identity as depending on difference. In fact, and that is our central argu ment, if conceptual difference is not asserted then impurity/ambiguity in empirical articulations evaporates from\n",

      "DISTINCTIONS AND ARTICULATIONS\n",
      " In our article Distinctions and articulations: A discourse theoretical framework for the study of populism and nationalism\n",
      " (De Cleen and Stavrakakis 2017, also see De Cleen 2017, De Cleen et al. 2019; Stavrakakis et al. 2017), we suggest\n",
      " a clear conceptual distinction between populism and nationalism as analytically distinct (but empirically often\n",
      " entangled) ways of discursively constructing and claiming to represent ‘the people', as underdog and as nation,\n",
      " respectively. Characteristic of populism, we argue, is that it interpellates citizens as members of ‘the people', consid ered as an underdog, and opposed along a vertical down/up axis to ‘the elite', conceived as a small and illegitimately\n",
      " powerful and privileged group. Nationalism, by contrast, interpellates people as members of ‘the nation' conceived as\n",
      " a limited and sovereign community that exists through time and is tied to a certain territory, with the nation being\n",
      " discursively constructed along a horizontal in/out axis that distinguishes (which should not be confused with\n",
      " ‘opposes') members from non-members, and the own nation from other nations. These definitions, we feel, are for mulated on a level of abstraction that allows them to capture the specificity of populism and nationalism, whilst also\n",
      " being able to cover the wide variety of concrete populist and nationalist politics. Most importantly, these definitions\n",
      " turn the concepts of populism and nationalism into sharp analytical tools allowing us to analyze their often intense,\n",
      " profound and indeed confusing entanglements.\n",
      "Crucially, as the ‘distinctions and articulations' title of our article indicates, these definitions of populism and\n",
      " nationalism are only the starting point of the empirical analysis of concrete populist and nationalist politics. Our defi nitions of populism and nationalism very explicitly do not aim to capture concrete populist or nationalist politics in\n",
      " their entirety and does not downgrade or deny the many relations between them in political practice. The conceptual\n",
      " distinction between populism and nationalism we put forward is aimed to serve as a basis for the empirical analysis\n",
      " of how populism and nationalism interact in real politics; it is not meant as an endpoint, but rather as the conceptual\n",
      " framework facilitating a nuanced account of the interactions between populism and nationalism on the ground. Such\n",
      " interactions, we suggest, can be better studied through the prism of contingent ‘articulation' and not through some\n",

      "A second level of critique is focused on our insistence that populism revolves around a vertical dimension more gen erally. For Brubaker, populism itself involves an intrinsic horizontal in/out dimension. This in/out dimension refers to\n",

      " At the heart of Brubaker's critique of our work and his own development of an alternative perspective on populism\n",
      " lies a disagreement about the role of concepts in analysis and about what concepts should and should not do. Our\n",
      " argument, basically, is that in order to study how populism and nationalism interact in practice we need to start from\n",
      " a clear conceptual distinction between the two. Populism and nationalism are most useful as conceptual tools to\n",
      " study populist, nationalist and populist-nationalist politics when the two concepts clearly identify the specificity of\n",
      " populism and nationalism and leave out all other elements—even if certain other elements are very often present in\n",
      " concrete populist or nationalist politics. We are not saying that populism and nationalism are separate empirical\n",
      " phenomena—quite the contrary, our aim being to develop a model for the study of their intricate interactions (‘articu lations' as we call them). Indeed, even if all populisms would be nationalist, it would still have important analytical\n",
      " advantages to identify the specific populist and nationalist dimensions of such politics. Moreover, if ‘populism' and\n",
      " ‘nationalism' did not have their specific character, would they manage to retain their independent symbolic existence\n",
      " and force within the history of our modern political vocabulary?\n",
      " Brubaker's argument is that the ambiguity of populist appeals to ‘the people' should be inscribed within the defi nition of populism itself. He writes:\n",
      " Distinguishing sharply between vertical appeals to ‘the people' as plebs and horizontal appeals to ‘the\n",
      " people' as bounded community—and assigning the former to populism and the latter to nationalism—\n",
      " externalizes the ambiguity of appeals to ‘the people'. It removes that ambiguity from populism as an\n",
      " object of analysis and locates it instead in the contingent empirical intertwining of two conceptually\n",
      " ‘pure' phenomena: populism and nationalism. I wish rather to internalize the ambiguity of appeals to\n",
      " ‘the people': I seek to highlight that ambiguity and to underscore its pragmatic power and productiv ity. The tight interweaving of vertical and horizontal registers, I shall argue, is central to and constitu tive of populist discourse; it is not merely a matter of the contingent articulation of different\n",
      " discourses (p. 10, emphasis added).\n",
      " In fact, Brubaker's and our discursive approach share a strong interest in understanding the ambiguity and multi dimensionality of populist-nationalist political projects. The difference seems to be that Brubaker wants to include\n",
      " that ambiguity into the concept of populism per se, whilst we feel that it is exactly the use of more minimal defini tions that capture the specificity of populism and nationalism (and only that specificity) and allows one to shed light\n",
      " on those empirical ambiguities and multi-dimensionalities. Our argument is not that populism and nationalism are\n",
      " “conceptually ‘pure' phenomena” or unambiguous “objects of analysis” (Brubaker 2019, p. 10), but rather that unam biguous concepts are needed to grasp the complexity of populism, nationalism and populism-nationalism combina tions as phenomena and as objects of analysis.\n",
      " Brubaker also writes that “[d]efinitionally restricting populism to vertical appeals in the name of ‘the people'\n",
      " against ‘the elite' misses the mutually constitutive relation of vertical and horizontal oppositions” (p. 12). But does it\n",
      "really? Our argument is, very explicitly, that a populist politics is never exhausted by its populist dimension. To under stand a particular populist politics we need to study the articulation between the populist dimension and the other\n",
      " dimensions of that politics: nationalist, often, but also socialist, conservative, authoritarian, and so on. This is one of\n",
      " the lessons of Laclau's discursive approach widely shared by more recent mainstream approaches to populism.\n",
      " An overly ‘thick' definition of populism, we feel, creates problems in that it no longer covers all populist politics,\n",
      " an issue Brubaker also alludes to when he writes that “my ‘family resemblance' definition, the elements of which are\n",

      " [...]. Populism is understood as a matter of degree; instances can be populist in some respects but not in others [...]”\n",
      " (p. 18). Moreover, it is exactly the more lean character of concepts that capture only the specificity of a particular\n",
      " phenomenon—and their explicit refusal to try to capture the whole richness of any empirical instance of that\n",
      " concept—that provides the conceptual sharpness needed to study empirical variety and multidimensionality. In fact,\n",
      " we very much agree with Brubaker's statement that “populism and nationalism are most fruitfully construed as ana lytically distinct but not analytically independent: as intersecting and mutually implicated though not fully over lapping fields of phenomena' (p. 2). We would just propose that these intersections and mutual implications between\n",
      " different interpellations of ‘the people' are best studied through concepts that do not themselves already overlap\n",
      " too much by trying to capture those intersections and mutual implications a priori. Moreover, any historical overlap\n",
