      "text/plain": "'Escaping Populism – Safeguarding Minority Rights:\\nNon-majoritarian Dynamics in European Policy-making*\\n EIKO THIELEMANN and NATASCHA ZAUN\\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science\\n Abstract\\nContrary to earlier predictions, communitarization in the area of asylum policies has not led to an\\nerosion of refugee rights. Instead, there is growing evidence that EU asylum harmonization has\\nsafeguarded existing standards and even enhanced the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees in\\nEurope. We seek to explain this by building on the insights of principal-agent theory. We argue\\nthat delegation to supranational institutions can strengthen non-majoritarian policy dynamics and\\nshield EU policy-makers from populist pressures for further immigration restrictions that national\\ngovernments are often confronted with. We support this argument empirically through a systematic longitudinal analysis of the evolution of EU asylum policies. In particular, we seek to assess\\nthe motivation for and impact of greater delegation to EU institutions on rights developments\\nfor asylum-seekers and refugees. We also explain to what extent EU policy-making has changed\\nwith the EU’s response to the ‘Syrian refugee crisis’.\\n Keywords: asylum; European Union institutions; justice and home affairs; minority rights; populism;\\nprincipal-agent theory\\n Introduction: EU Asylum Co-operation and the Rights of Refugees in Europe\\n Immigration and asylum matters have long been critically observed by the public. In the\\nUK’s referendum on the European Union (EU), they were highly politicized by supporters of the Leave campaign, who fuelled strong anti-immigrant attitudes present\\namong large parts of the electorate, arguing that leaving the EU would stop uncontrolled\\nimmigration to the UK (Dathan, 2016). But this of course is not just a British phenomenon. Across the EU large parts of the electorate favour a decrease in immigration, which\\nmakes even moderate parties from across the political spectrum adopt anti-immigrant positions (Alonso and Claro da Fonseca, 2012, p. 867). Given widespread public resentment, policy-makers face a dilemma as the logic of majoritarian politics calling for\\nfurther restrictions often stands in contrast to the basic human rights obligations of liberal\\nstates, particularly those concerning the protection of refugees. Historically, nonmajoritarian institutions, such as national courts, have provided a counterweight to populist pressures for restricting minority rights and played an important role in safeguarding\\nstates’ adherence to basic human rights of migrants (Joppke, 2001).\\nThe rise of EU co-operation has been viewed by many as threatening that role (seem\\nfor example, Fry, 2005; Hathaway, 2003). It has been argued that EU policy-making\\nhas strengthened the role of the executive, reduced accountability and limited judicial\\noversight in European policy-making. Some have even viewed the EU level as a strategic\\n * The authors would like to thank three anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

Recent developments such as the 2016 EU–Turkey Statement on\\nthe return of forced migrants to Turkey have again highlighted such concerns.\\nWhen assessing the broader impact of the EU, predictions about an EU-induced erosion\\nof migrants’ rights increasingly seem at odds with the empirical reality. Studies point to numerous examples where adopting common standards has necessitated legislative changes\\nand the adoption of rights-enhancing policies in the Member States (El-Enany and\\nThielemann, 2011; Kaunert, 2009, 2010; Kaunert and Léonard, 2012; Zaun, 2016, 2017).\\nHowever, theoretical attempts to explain such dynamics have, with notable exceptions\\n(Kaunert, 2009, 2010; Kaunert and Léonard, 2012; Zaun, 2016, 2017), remained limited.\\nZaun(2016, 2017),forinstance, argues that liberalizations during theﬁrst phaseof the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) can be explained by the dominance of ‘strong regulators’ (states with a long regulatory tradition in the ﬁeld and a well-functioning\\nadministration) trying to impose their standards on ‘weak regulators’. However, this argument isunableto explain standards exceeding thelowest common denominator of thestrong\\nregulators.Kaunert (2009,)andKaunert andLéonard(2012)havearguedthattheEU’s\\ntechnocratic and legalistic approach can account for EU asylum policy liberalization. Yet, it\\nremains puzzling why Member States with their alleged restrictive preferences would delegate to institutions that produce policies at odds with these preferences.\\nThis article draws on the principle-agent literature to advance our theoretical understanding of the motivation and the consequences of delegating asylum policy-making\\nto EU institutions. It argues that by delegating agenda-setting, decision-making and implementation in the area of asylum to EU institutions (the agents), national governments\\n(the principals) strengthen non-majoritarian policy dynamics that shield European policymakers from some of the populist pressures that national governments face (Thatcher and\\nStone Sweet, 2002, p. 2). We therefore expect more non-majoritarian policy dynamics to\\npromote more liberal (less restrictive) standards. Hence, the more communitarized EU\\nasylum policies are, the more likely they will be to safeguard or strengthen minority\\nrights. The concepts of non-majoritarian and majoritarian institutions are best understood\\nas two ends of a continuum rather than two clearly distinguishable alternatives. The European Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) are certainly\\nthe least subject to electoral pressures among the EU institutions. The European Parliament (EP) takes a middle-ground position. As an elected body, the EP is by deﬁnition a\\nmajoritarian institution. Yet, when speaking of non-majoritarian institutions, we focus\\non their separation from anti-immigrant attitudes existing in the wider national electorate.\\nArguably, the EP is much better shielded from populist pressures than national parliaments, and its greater distance from voters has long been the subject of criticism (see\\nMarquand, 1979, p. 64 on ‘democratic deﬁcit’). Not only is the turnout of voters substantially lower than in national elections, political parties in the EP also represent a variety of\\ncleavages, as they are composed of parties from Member States that share limited communalities. Being composed of representatives from national ministries, the Council is certainly the ‘most majoritarian’ among the EU institutions. Yet, working in a less\\n 1 While the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) is not directly part of the EU architecture, delegation to this court\\ncan also have an important impact on asylum policy-making, as the CJEU and the ECtHR have been demonstrated to crossreference each other on a regular basis in different areas of EU policy-making (Jacobs, 2003).\\n Escaping populism – safeguarding minority rights\\n907\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\ntransparent and more complex institutional environment, the Council’s decisions are under less severe scrutiny than national government decisions, which enables the Council to\\nshift blame for unpopular policies to Brussels.\\nEmpirically, we support our argument through a comparative analysis of EU asylum\\nstandards before and after the introduction of ordinary legislative procedure. This assessment will be complemented with a discussion about the extent to which non-majoritarian\\npolicy dynamics and their rights-enhancing effects have been challenged by the EU’s response to the 2015 ‘Syrian Crisis’.\\n I. Escaping Populism through Delegation: The Role of Non-majoritarian Politics in\\nEU Policy-making\\n Motivation for Delegation\\n ‘Principal-agent’ theory and its application to the EU (Pollack, 1997, pp. 103–104;\\nThatcher and Stone Sweet, 2002, p. 4) suggests two types of motivation for delegation\\nwhich are important in the area of asylum: enhancing the credibility of commitments\\nand enabling unpopular decisions such as the protection of minority rights which are often\\nunderrepresented in majoritarian systems. It has been persuasively argued that, ﬁrst, delegation can limit free-riding opportunities by enhancing the credibility of a commitment,\\nand second, that it allows policy-makers to escape the ‘diktat’ of the majority and the\\nshort-term focus that often characterizes policies emerging from majoritarian institutions\\nadhering to the logic of electoral cycles (Thatcher and Stone Sweet, 2002, pp. 4, 9–10).\\nThatcher and Stone Sweet (2002, p. 4) also highlight that principals establish agents to\\nresolve problems of commitment in the case of collective action problems, for example,\\nbetween multiple principles. Delegation in the EU context is therefore not necessarily a\\nsymmetrical process initiated by all Member States to the same extent. Instead, those\\nMember States that have the impression that others are free-riding use delegation to prevent them from doing so. Moreover, delegation provides ‘principals’ with opportunities to\\nescape populist pressures and legislate on controversial issues, such as asylum policy.\\nThus, they can avoid paying the electoral price that legislation in this area often implies\\nfor moderate parties, given the widespread restrictive preferences of the electorate\\n(Alonso and Claro da Fonseca, 2012; Howard, 2010) and the fact that populist parties\\nare always ready to adopt more restrictive positions. Due to the restrictive preferences\\nof the electorate, policy-makers will feel forced to adopt restrictive policies, even if this\\nrisks bringing their country into conﬂict with its obligations under international law. This\\nis particularly the case when right-wing populist parties hold a signiﬁcant part of the electorate (Howard, 2010, p. 744). Delegation provides national policy-makers with additional leeway, as policy outcomes at the EU level will not be immediately associated\\nwith them and even enable them to blame ‘Brussels’ for unpopular decisions.\\n The Expected Impact of Delegation\\n In the case of European asylum policies, delegation to EU institutions can be expected to\\nsafeguard protection standards for asylum-seekers by isolating European policy-making\\nfrom populist pressures at home. This, of course, follows partly from the motivation for\\ndelegation. However, EU institutions have also been demonstrated to engage in\\n Eiko Thielemann and Natascha Zaun\\n908\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\n‘bureaucratic drift’, promoting positions that are different from those of their principals\\n(Burley and Mattli, 1993; Pollack, 1997, p. 108). Therefore, it is also possible that the\\nEU institutions (the agents) adopt positions that are more pro-integrationist and more liberal than Member States could subscribe to.\\nWhen the decision-making rules are more supranational, the inﬂuence of nonmajoritarian institutions like the Commission can be expected to be greater. Hence one\\nwould expect higher (less restrictive) standards the more supranational (communitarized)\\nthese rules are.\\nEuropean migration governance has been fundamentally transformed over the past\\nthree decades. Today’s governance rules for asylum matters under the Lisbon Treaty operate under the same supranational arrangements existing for the most integrated parts of\\nthe EU project, such as the Single Market. Through delegation we can expect an increasing inﬂuence of the (more) liberal preferences of ‘supranational agents’ on policy outcomes at all three stages of the policy-making process: agenda-setting, decision-making\\nand policy implementation.\\nThe Commission now holds the monopoly of legislative initiatives and has enhanced\\nits inﬂuence as decisions in the Council are taken by qualiﬁed majority voting (and no\\nlonger by unanimity) (Pollack, 1997, p. 106). The EP is a co-legislator with full veto powers and the CJEU has the authority to adjudicate over both the making and the implementation of EU policies. Delegation can also limit discretion and non-compliance during\\nimplementation as EU institutions can help with the ‘completion of incomplete contracts’\\nand provide independent oversight. As Burley and Mattli (1993) have shown, delegation\\nto the CJEU can play a crucial role in narrowing implementation gaps. With the Lisbon\\nTreaty, Member States have extended the delegation of powers to the CJEU. No longer\\nis the preliminary reference procedure limited to national courts or last instance courts,\\nbut instead it is now available to all national courts (House of Lords European Union\\nCommittee, 2008, p. 125–126). Judicial activism has also probably further strengthened\\nthe impact of these newly delegated powers.\\nOf course, the increased powers of non-majoritarian institutions do not imply that the\\nCouncil has become a marginal actor in EU asylum policy-making. However, ceteris\\nparibus non-majoritarian institutions are likely to have a stronger impact in the second\\nphase than in the ﬁrst phase of the CEAS, given the more communitarized decisionmaking mode applied. As their positions are more liberal than those of the Council, policy\\noutputs are therefore likely to be more liberal.\\n II. Why Member States have Delegated Asylum Policy-making to the EU\\n Member States have opted for delegation to EU institutions in asylum policy-making for\\ntwo reasons. First, they deployed delegation to limit dynamics of ‘responsibility-shifting’.\\nWhile previous co-operation in a purely intergovernmental setting attempted to overcome\\nthese dynamics, it was not able to achieve this goal, because commitments could not be\\nenforced (Stetter, 2000). Second, through delegating to the technocratic EU decisionmaking environment, asylum policies, which have often been exploited by right-wing\\npopulist parties (Rydgren, 2004), are being depoliticized.\\nResponsibility-shifting follows from collective action problems in refugee protection.\\nAccording to Suhrke (1998) the security gains resulting from refugee protection have\\n Escaping populism – safeguarding minority rights\\n909\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\nsome characteristics of a non-excludable public good. States therefore have an incentive\\nto free-ride on others. As refugee protection involves costs, states adopt restrictive policies to encourage asylum-seekers to seek protection elsewhere. In the EU, this can lead\\nto a regulatory ‘race to the bottom’ as Member States adopt more restrictive policies to\\nbecome less attractive to asylum-seekers relative to other Member States (Thielemann,\\n2006). These dynamics could be observed before asylum policies were delegated to the\\nEU. In the 1990s, Northern European Member States received the largest share of\\nasylum-seekers in Europe. To curb free-riding and to advance a more equitable sharing\\nof refugee responsibilities across Europe, these states had an interest in enhanced\\ncommunitarization. Germany was a particularly fervent supporter of harmonization and\\nquota-based responsibility-sharing mechanisms at the EU level during the negotiations\\nof the Maastricht Treaty and the early negotiations of the Amsterdam Treaty. However,\\nwhen asylum applications started to decline again, Germany’s enthusiasm for further delegation to the EU also cooled. During the negotiations of the Constitutional Treaty (that\\nultimately resulted in the Lisbon Treaty), Germany blocked full harmonization, while the\\nUK became the main supporter of greater delegation at the time as its numbers of asylum\\napplications were the highest in Europe (Zaun 2017, p. 67). As soon as applications to the\\nUK declined again, it lost interest in enhanced EU co-operation and even opted out of\\nmuch of the second phase of the CEAS (Thielemann and El-Enany, 2013, p. 220).\\nThe analysis of the negotiations of EU asylum instruments over the years support the\\nargument that greater delegation to the EU was perceived to limit free-riding by\\npreventing Member States from encouraging secondary movements through unilateral\\npolicy restrictions. This logic was effectively summarized in a Council discussion paper\\non the reception conditions directive in which the French delegation promoted greater\\nEU policy harmonization, suggesting that the ‘he disparity between reception arrangements in Europe makes certain Member States more attractive than others for asylum applicants. Harmonization in this respect would reduce these secondary movements […]’\\n(Council of Ministers, 2000a).\\nThe desire of national politicians to de-politicize refugee policy-making in order to\\nlower the ‘temperature’ of the domestic debates on asylum and to prevent populist parties\\nfrom exploiting the issue has been another motivation for delegation that can be supported\\nthrough evidence. In the case of Germany, for instance, asylum was a hotly debated issue\\nin the early 1990s and populism fuelled multiple attacks on immigrants. There was thus\\nstrong consensus among policy-makers to avoid new legislative debates on asylum. According to a well-placed observer of the German debates at the time, politicians know that\\nasylum and migration policies ‘are perfect topics to lose an election with, if you are not\\ncareful’ or more speciﬁcally ‘topic[s] that can cost moderate parties their head, because\\nthey cannot convince the voter […], whilst populist parties are […] strengthened’ (Interview, Think Tank 1). A former ofﬁcial from the German Interior Ministry conﬁrms:\\n‘After arsons directed against refugee reception centres in 1992/1993 […] politicians\\nhad a strong interest in asylum policies not being discussed publicly again’ (Interview, Interior Ministry_DE). Another example supports our assumption that policy-makers\\nmainly fear punishment by an anti-immigrant electorate. When asked about the reason\\nwhy Member States de jure maintain a highly inefﬁcient distribution mechanism\\n(Dublin III) which is no longer applied in practice, they respond that Dublin has a mainly\\nsymbolic function and should signal to the electorate that policy-makers keep tight\\n Eiko Thielemann and Natascha Zaun\\n910\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\ncontrol over refugee inﬂows (Interview, Consultant). The EU was considered an attractive\\nalternative venue to the national arena, because EU policy-making processes were more\\nobscure, technical and de-politicized.\\n III. The Impact of Non-majoritarian Dynamics on European Asylum Standards\\n To empirically assess the impact of non-majoritarian dynamics, we will, ﬁrst, compare the\\nthree principal legal instruments developed during the ﬁrst phase of the CEAS between\\n2000 and 20052 with their ‘recasts’ during the second CEAS phase from 2008 until\\n2013. The ﬁrst and the second phase of the CEAS are ‘most similar cases’ (cf. Seawright\\nand Gerring, 2008, pp. 304–306), except for the decision-making procedures, which are\\n 2 These are the Reception Conditions Directive (Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2003), the Qualiﬁcation Directive (Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004) and the Asylum Procedures Directive (Council Directive 2005/85/EC\\nof 1 December 2005).\\n3 These are the recast reception conditions directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June\\n2013, the recast Qualiﬁcation Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 December 2011 and\\nthe recast Asylum Procedures Directive of 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013.\\n Table 1: Positions of the three legislative institutions on key issues (relative to status quo ante) and\\noutcome of ﬁnal agreement (relative to status quo ante)\\n Directive\\nIssue\\nCommission1\\nEuropean\\nParliament2\\nCouncil3\\nFinal\\nAgreement3\\n RCD\\nScope\\n+\\n+\\n0\\n+\\nDetention (Grounds for)\\n++\\n++\\n0\\n+\\nAccess to work\\n++\\n++\\n0\\n+\\nAccess\\nto\\nmaterial\\nreception\\nconditions\\n++\\n+\\n0\\n+\\n Vulnerable applicants with special\\nreception needs\\n++\\n++\\n0\\n+\\n QD\\nFamily deﬁnition\\n++\\n+\\n0\\n+\\nDeﬁnition of actors of protection\\n+\\n+\\n�\\n+\\nInternal Protection Alternative\\n+\\n+\\n0\\n+\\nRights of beneﬁciaries of subsidiary\\nprotection\\n++\\n+\\n0\\n+\\n Gender-related persecution\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n+\\nAPD\\nAccess to procedure\\n+\\n+\\n0\\n+\\nRights related to personal interview\\n+\\n+\\n0\\n+/�\\nFree legal information at 1st instance\\n++\\n++\\n0\\n+\\nRight to remain in case of\\nsubsequent applications\\n�\\n�\\n�\\n�\\n Right to an effective remedy\\n+\\n+\\n0\\n+\\n Key: + stronger safeguards and/or more rights compared to status quo ++ stronger safeguards as compared to the other institutions on this speciﬁc issue; yet, this does not imply safeguards twice as high as + – weakened safeguards and/or reduced\\nrights 0 reﬂecting status quo.\\nNotes: 1 The Commission’s position is based on the (ﬁrst) recast proposal submitted by the Commission. 2 The European\\nParliament’s position is based on its amendments on the (ﬁrst) recast Commission proposal. 3 The Council’s position is\\nbased on reactions by Member States lowest common denominator in the Council working groups at their ﬁrst meeting\\nsubsequent to the submission of the Commission proposal. 4 The assessment of the ﬁnal agreements is based on the recast\\ndirectives and evaluations of ECRE about the main changes. We follow ECRE’s interpretation regarding rights-enhancing\\nand rights-reducing legislative output.\\n Escaping populism – safeguarding minority rights\\n911\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\nonly partly communitarized in the ﬁrst phase of the CEAS but fully communitarized in its\\nsecond phase. This represents the design of a ‘natural experiment’ and allows us to hold\\nall variables constant except for the one under investigation, namely the strengthened\\ncompetences of non-majoritarian institutions through increased delegation. Focusing on\\nthe Reception Conditions Directive, we then trace the role of non-majoritarian dynamics\\non policy outputs at the EU level (policy on paper). In this context, we ﬁrst study the\\nagenda-setting role of the Commission and the CJEU as well as the inﬂuence of the\\nEP. Second, we look into the Commission’s and the CJEU’s role in holding Member\\nStates accountable in the implementation process (policy in practice).\\n Comparing Policy Output on the Three Core Directives\\n Comparing the policy output on the three core directives across the two periods, we ﬁnd\\nrights enhancements on most policies (see Table 1). The Reception Conditions Directive\\nis now applied to all applicants (scope), including those that are subject to procedures under the Dublin Regulation and accelerated or border procedures. The special reception\\nneeds of vulnerable applicants are to be accounted for and an exhaustive list on detention\\ngrounds is introduced prohibiting arbitrary detention or detention on other grounds. Access to work is now permitted after nine months instead of twelve months in the original\\ndirective. Lastly, the directive introduces limits for the grounds on which Member States\\nmay set different modalities for material reception conditions, requiring access to health\\ncare and a digniﬁed living standard even where material reception conditions are reduced\\nand withdrawn, while no longer considering late submission of an application as a ground\\nfor the refusal of reception conditions. The special needs of vulnerable applicants are now\\nalso to be recognized.\\nThe family deﬁnition of the Qualiﬁcation Directive is extended and minor children of\\ninternational protection beneﬁciaries are no longer explicitly required to be dependent. In\\nthe deﬁnition of actors of protection, a requirement is introduced that such protection\\nneeds to be effective and non-temporary and the internal protection alternative is only applied if the person can settle there, not withstanding technical obstacles. The rights of refugees and beneﬁciaries of subsidiary protection are furthermore aligned and gender and\\ngender identity are criteria to be accounted for when assessing membership of a ‘particular social group’.\\nFollowing the Procedures Directive, asylum-seekers should have access to a procedure\\nwith clear deadlines for the registration of the asylum application. In addition to free legal\\naid in case of negative decisions provided by the original Procedures Directive, the recast\\ndirective grants free legal aid at ﬁrst instance procedures. Moreover, it strengthens access to\\nan effective remedy by establishing the right to a full and ex nunc examination of facts, requiring courts to base their judgment not only on facts established during the ﬁrst instance\\nprocedure but also to consider new relevant information. The legislative output on the personal interview is rather mixed. On the one hand, the option to omit it is now limited to\\ncases where a positive decision can be taken or where the applicant is considered unable\\nto be interviewed. On the other hand, the option to temporarily involve personnel from another authority is introduced to account for times of high volume of applications, which\\nrisks involving inadequately trained personnel. Additionally, the right to remain in case\\nof subsequent applications is further limited in cases where no additional information\\n Eiko Thielemann and Natascha Zaun\\n912\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\nsubstantiating the claim is submitted and where the subsequent claim is made ‘merely in\\norder to the delay or frustrate the enforcement of a decision’ (Art. 41 para. 1 lit. a).\\nIn sum, there are far more rights enhancements than downgrades in all asylum directives of the second phase of the CEAS. Contrary to the expectations in much of the literature, increased delegation to the EU goes hand in hand with more (rather than fewer)\\nrights for asylum-seekers and refugees in Europe. As Table 1 shows, the Commission\\nand, to a slightly lesser extent, the EP consistently advance more liberal positions compared to both the status quo and those advanced by the institution most strongly connected to national electorates, the Council. This supports our expectation that the\\nCommission has the strongest non-majoritarian characteristics among the three institutions, while the Council is most majoritarian and the EP takes a somewhat ‘middle\\nground’ position between the two. While the Parliament has been demonstrated to adopt\\nmore conservative positions during the second phase of the CEAS (Ripoll Servent and\\nTrauner, 2014, pp. 1148–1149), this may be attributed to the fact that it is now a colegislator taking an active part in the negotiations and thus needing to compromise with\\nthe Council to promote their positions on various issues. In consultation procedure, it\\ncould only make itself heard by adopting extreme positions that could clearly be identiﬁed\\nas coming from the EP. As it is not a co-legislator, the Commission took the role of the\\nvisionary in the second phase of the CEAS and suggested comparatively progressive policies on the recast Procedures Directive, the recast Reception Conditions Directive and the\\nDublin III Regulation. Yet, as all these proposals were considered too progressive by\\nsome Member States in the Council (Interview, PermRep#1; Interview, PermRep#2; Interview, PermRep#3; Interview, PermRep#4), it had to revise them.\\nHence, while neither the Commission nor the EP always get their maximum positions\\ninto EU legislation, their original positions are usually more liberal than the status quo\\nand, as we will show later, they are able to draw legislative output more effectively towards their preferred output in the second phase of the CEAS.\\nSome scholars have questioned the signiﬁcance of these changes and referred to them\\nas ‘changes of secondary order’ (Ripoll Servent and Trauner, 2014, p. 1153). Yet, while\\nEU standards could certainly be higher and retain the focus on controlling the immigration of asylum-seekers (Ripoll Servent and Trauner, 2014, p. 1142), these changes lead\\nto important rights enhancements for asylum-seekers and refugees in several EU Member\\nStates. For example, some Member States employed detention as a general practice for\\nnew asylum-seekers. In Malta, asylum-seekers were detained as a matter of course, which\\nunder the new EU provisions is no longer possible (Interview, PermRep#2). Earlier labour market access in Germany and France can potentially improve the integration of\\nasylum-seekers that were denied it previously. The internal protection alternative is often\\nused to provide applicants with a ‘leave to remain’ but to deny them an actual status, even\\nwhere they could not be returned due to technical obstacles.\\n The Agenda-setting Powers of the Commission and the European Courts\\n In this section, we will explain raised standards through the enhanced agenda-setting\\npowers of non-majoritarian institutions. Although they are interlinked, we distinguish\\ntwo types of agenda-setting. The ﬁrst type is the Commission’s agenda-setting through\\nits right of initiative. As suggested earlier, the Commission’s agenda-setting powers are\\n Escaping populism – safeguarding minority rights\\n913\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\nenhanced under qualiﬁed majority vote in the Council, because Member States can be\\noutvoted and the Commission proposal does not need to accommodate all outliers but\\ncan instead set a course. The second type of agenda-setting powers relates to the judicial\\nreview of the CJEU. If the CJEU rules that a national practice is out of line with EU law, a\\nneed for further EU legislation is created, closing potential gaps in the already existing\\ninstruments. Additionally, the increased ‘juridiﬁcation’ (Kaunert and Léonard, 2012)\\nhas enhanced the competences of the ECtHR, which has already drawn on EU legislation\\nto substantiate its argumentation (see the judgment MSS vs. Belgium and Greece, ECtHR,\\n2011). In the following section, we will illustrate the two types of enhanced agendasetting powers using the examples of access to work and detention from the Reception\\nConditions Directive.\\n Access to Work\\n Access to work was considered one of the most controversial issues from the very beginning of the negotiations. It was among the most contested issues in the ﬁrst and the second\\nphase of the CEAS. Some Member States (France and Germany, for example) feared that\\nan early labour market access could be a pull-factor that would increase the number of applicants. Other Member States (Sweden and the Netherlands, for example) and the Commission argued that early access would help to integrate asylum-seekers and alleviate\\npressures on national welfare systems (Council of Ministers, 2000b, p. 2; Interview,\\nPermRep#3; Interview, PermRep#4).\\nIn the original directive, access to work was granted after one year. The recast directive\\nprovides it after nine months. This is more liberal than the standard provided in two traditionally strong Member States, Germany and France. These Member States favoured\\nlate access to work in order to send a signal both to potential asylum-seekers and the electorate (Interview, Consultant) and had blocked any attempts by the Commission and other\\nMember States to introduce earlier access in the original Reception Conditions Directive\\n(Zaun, 2016, pp. 145–146). The higher protection standard provided by the recast directive can be explained through the enhanced role of non-majoritarian institutions.\\nDebates on the recast Reception Conditions Directive were initiated by the Commission and were based on the implementation studies of the Commission, NGOs, and\\ngroups of legal experts which highlighted gaps and inconsistencies in implementation\\nresulting from ambiguous wording in the directives. As access to work was, again, considered a core issue in the directive, the Commission dedicated a whole paragraph to it\\nin the introduction, elaborating why access should be granted after six months – six\\nmonths earlier than in the original Reception Conditions Directive (European Commission, 2008, p. 5).\\nWith the qualiﬁed majority vote in the Council, the Commission’s agenda-setting\\npower was enhanced and Germany and France, the only Member States to oppose access\\nto work earlier than 12months, could no longer block it. The nine months laid down in the\\ndirective represent a compromise between the Commission’s position to have it after six\\nmonths (European Commission, 2008, p. 24) and these two restrictive Member States\\n(Council of Ministers, 2012, p. 39). Initially the EP sided with the Commission, advancing labour market access after six months (European Parliament, 2009). Eventually, however, the EP and the Council met in the middle and agreed on a maximum period of nine\\n Eiko Thielemann and Natascha Zaun\\n914\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\nmonths. At the same time the EP accepted the Council’s demand to keep most of the\\nexisting conditions, for example, that asylum-seekers will only have access to the labour\\nmarket if no decision has been taken on their claim within the period of nine months\\n(Peers, 2012, p. 5).\\n Detention\\n The practice of detaining asylum-seekers during the application procedures has always\\nbeen criticized by NGOs (ECRE, 1996). However, Member States sought to keep tight\\ncontrol of this issue during the ﬁrst phase of the CEAS. The original Reception Conditions\\nDirective does not deﬁne the conditions under which Member States may or may not detain asylum-seekers. The recast directive introduces an article proposing that only a limited\\nnumber of detention grounds are valid (Art. 8). The ﬁve exclusive reasons for detention\\nare: (a) veriﬁcation of identity, (b) determination of elements which can only be obtained\\nthrough detention (for example, in case of a risk of absconding), (c) related to a decision on\\nthe right to enter the territory in an asylum procedure, (d) in case of repeat applications submitted by applicants who try to circumvent detention for return/extradition, and (e) when\\nprotection of national security or public order so requires. Moreover, asylum-seekers shall\\nnot be detained for the sole reason that they apply for asylum (para. 1) and detention is conditional on the individual assessment of each case (para. 2). This article was inserted ‘taking into consideration the wide use of detention for asylum-seekers by Member States and\\nthe developing case law of the European Court of Human Rights’ (European Commission,\\n2008, p. 6). The case law referred to by the Commission is that of Saadi v. the United\\nKingdom (ECtHR, 2008). In this case the dissenting vote of six judges held that Art. 18\\npara. 1 of the Procedures Directive should be considered an adjunct to the rules set in\\nArt. 7 of the reception conditions directive. Thus, ‘Member States shall not hold a person\\nin detention for the sole reason that he/she is an applicant for asylum’. The Commission\\nmakes the same link between the procedures directive and the reception conditions directive in their legislative proposal. This is reﬂected in para. 1 of the article.\\nThe provision that detention should be made conditional on the individual assessment\\nof a case goes back to Recommendation Rec(2003)5 of the Committee of Ministers to\\nMember States on measures of detention of asylum-seekers. According to paragraph 4\\nof this recommendation, ‘[m]easures of detention of asylum-seekers should be applied\\nonly after a careful examination of their necessity in each individual case’. According\\nto the recommendation detention is lawful ‘when protection of national security and public order so requires’ which made its way into para. 2 lit. e.\\nPara. 2 lit. c is an exception which was already conﬁrmed by most ECtHR judges (11)\\nin the case of Saadi v. the United Kingdom. According to them the UK practice of\\ndetaining applicants to accelerate the asylum procedure did not violate Art. 5 para. 1\\nECHR (right to liberty and security), as each state has the right to decide to whom it\\ngrants access to its territory (para. 65).\\nFollowing Conclusion No. 44 of the Executive Committee of the UNHCR Programme,\\nthe UNHCR’s Guidelines, and the Committee of Ministers’ Recommendation, detention\\nof asylum-seekers is lawful under certain circumstances, for example while identity\\nchecks are taking place, when elements comprising the asylum claim need to be determined or when public order requires. This is reﬂected in para. 2 lit. a, b and e.\\n Escaping populism – safeguarding minority rights\\n915\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\nFour out of these ﬁve grounds for detention were already part of the Commission proposal (European Commission, 2008, p. 20). Only one ground was added by the Council,\\nwhich stated in lit. d that applicants can be detained for purposes of expulsion if the Member\\nStates can show that the person concerned only applied for asylum to delay the procedure.\\nSome Member States wanted to add additional grounds for detention. One Member\\nState suggested adding a lack of co-operation by the asylum-seeker while another Member State wanted to introduce illegal entry as a ground for detention (Council of Ministers,\\n2010, p. 3, footnote 6). This likely was Malta, as Malta usually detained asylum-seekers\\nfor irregular entry (PermRep#2). The Commission, however, argued that adding such\\nvague grounds could lead to systematic detention of asylum-seekers (Council of Ministers, 2010, p. 3, footnote 6). Eventually, the EP convinced the Council to drop apprehension for an irregular stay as a detention ground. The EP and the Commission, moreover,\\nensured that detention as part of expulsion was limited to cases in which the return directive applied (Peers, 2012, p. 4).\\nThe case of detention shows that the Commission (and the EP) used court rulings as a\\ntool for introducing safeguards for asylum-seekers in detention and to limit the number of\\ndetention grounds.\\n The Role of the Commission and the EU Court in Holding Member States to Account\\n Both the Commission and the CJEU had a right to enforce refugees’ and asylum-seekers’\\nrights in the implementation phase as well and thus could and did raise standards in policy\\noutcomes. For instance, the Commission could initiate infringement procedures against\\nstates for non-implementation and the courts could assess whether Member States’ implementation was in line with EU law.\\nIn the ﬁrst phase only the Court made use of its right to enforce more effective implementation. While the Commission had initiated an infringement procedure against Greece\\nfor non-implementation of Art. 26 of the original Reception Conditions Directive, it did\\nnot initiate a single content-related infringement procedure. Yet, there was a wide consensus that a number of Member States, particularly in Southern Europe and some of the new\\nEastern European Member States, had not correctly transposed the directives, maintaining\\nsevere deﬁciencies in their asylum systems. At the height of the 2015 crisis, the Commission eventually initiated infringement procedures: 40 infringement decisions against\\nMember States were launched in September 2015 for non-implementation of EU legislation and in December 2015 the Commission initiated an infringement procedure against\\nGreece, Croatia, Italy, Malta and Hungary for non-implementation of the CEAS (Carrera\\net al., 2015, p. 14; European Commission, 2015).\\nThe CJEU, which was often informed by judgment of the European Court of Human\\nRights (ECtHR), left an even stronger mark on EU legislation. The ECtHR decisions MSS\\nv Belgium and Greece (ECtHR, 2011) and Tarakhel v Switzerland (ECtHR, 2014) and the\\nCJEU decision NS vs. Netherlands (CJEU, 2011) have determined the insufﬁciencies of\\nSouthern European asylum systems and demonstrated that these Member States had not\\nfully transposed EU asylum directives. In MSS v Belgium and Greece, an Afghan citizen\\nﬁled an asylum application in Belgium after entering through Greece. In line with Dublin\\nII, he was sent back to Greece and detained in degrading conditions, and became homeless upon his release with no access to work or social beneﬁts. The ECtHR suggested that\\n Eiko Thielemann and Natascha Zaun\\n916\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\nGreece had not transposed the Reception Conditions Directive (and the Procedures Directive) and ruled that Greece’s detention and reception conditions violated Art. 3 ECHR,\\nwhich prohibits torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. Moreover, the Court ruled\\nthat Greece had violated Art. 13 ECHR (right to an effective remedy) in conjunction with\\nArt. 3 ECHR. This was due to the deﬁciencies of the asylum procedure and the risk the\\nclaimant faced in being returned to his country of origin without thorough examination\\nof fact and law and access to a legal remedy. Belgium, too, had violated Art. 3 ECHR\\nfor exposing the applicant to the degrading detention and living conditions in Greece\\nwithout prior assessment of the situation. It had thus also violated Art. 13 ECHR in conjunction with Art. 3 ECHR, as it did not provide any access to legal remedies in the\\nframework of Dublin transfers. The Court said that ‘any complaint that expulsion to another country will expose an individual to treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention requires close and rigorous scrutiny and that, subject to a certain margin of\\nappreciation left to the States, conformity with Article 13 requires that the competent\\nbody must be able to examine the substance of the complaint and afford proper reparation’ (ECtHR, 2011, pp. 80–81). Eventually, this ruling led to a de facto suspension of\\nDublin transfers to Greece. In Tarakhel v Switzerland (ECtHR, 2014) this ruling was conﬁrmed and extended to Italy. This further questioned the legitimacy and practicability of\\nthe Dublin system. Shortly after MSS v Belgium and Greece, the CJEU (2011) ruled in NS\\nv UK and ME and Others v Ireland that a Dublin transfer is not allowed when the transferring Member State ‘cannot be unaware that systemic deﬁciencies in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions of asylum-seekers in that Member State amount to\\nsubstantial grounds for believing that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being\\nsubjected to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 4 of the\\n[EU] Charter’ (paras. 94 and 106). The CJEU judgment is remarkable, as the CJEU to\\nsome extent questioned the mutual recognition of asylum decisions under all circumstances and hence fostered a retrenchment in European integration. The CJEU has often\\nbeen described as strongly pro-integrationist (Burley and Mattli, 1993). Yet, in this case\\nit prioritized the human rights standards laid down in the EU Charter. The adoption of\\nthe Charter with the Lisbon Treaty seems to have furthered CJEU’s role as a guardian\\nof human rights, even at the expense of EU integration.\\n Conclusion\\n This article has demonstrated that transferring asylum policies to the EU level does not\\ndecrease the number of checks and balances policy-makers are faced with, particularly\\nwith the move towards the ordinary legislative procedure. It therefore should not be\\nviewed as an act of restrictive venue-shopping as previously argued by scholars. Instead,\\nthe EU-level policy-making provides mechanisms that tend to safeguard and strengthen\\nminority rights, even when Member States in the Council have more restrictive preferences. Analyzing EU asylum policy-making from a principal-agent perspective helps to\\nunderstand why the Commission, the CJEU and the EP – institutions that are more insulated from majoritarian pressures than national governments – have consistently adopted\\npolicy positions that are less restrictive than those of the Council. Delegation to supranational institutions strengthens non-majoritarian governance and allows national governments to depoliticize unpopular migration policies. In turn, such delegation helps to\\n Escaping populism – safeguarding minority rights\\n917\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\nsafeguard minority rights against populist pressures for greater restrictions. Delegation\\ndynamics can therefore account for the fact that common EU policies go beyond the ‘lowest common denominator’ and are often less restrictive even than policies found in Member States that are ‘strong regulators’ (see Zaun, 2016).\\nTwo principal objections can be raised with regards to the arguments developed above.\\nFirst, while the authority and inﬂuence of non-majoritarian institutions in policy-making\\nhas increased, Member States often remain in the driving seat when it comes to the implementation of EU policies. This can lead to highly heterogeneous outcomes across the\\nMember States, which can make a mockery of new safeguards and new rights agreed\\nto at the EU level. While we have recently been able to observe a greater ability by the\\nCommission and the CJEU to hold Member States accountable over implementation, it\\nis important to acknowledge that strengthened standards on paper are only a necessary\\nbut not a sufﬁcient condition for greater safeguards on the ground. However, recent Commission proposals to transform some of the EU’s core asylum directives into regulations\\nto reduce Member State discretion (European Commission, 2016a, 2016b) and initiatives\\nto delegate greater authority to the European Asylum Support Ofﬁce (European Commission, 2016c) over national implementation measures, are steps to promote better compliance and enforceability of commitments. Second, one might argue that the EU’s response\\nto the Syrian crisis poses a challenge to our central claims, pointing to the highly restrictive nature of the EU–Turkey Statement (European Commission, 2016d) and the limitations of the EU’s emergency response legislation, particularly with regard to relocation.\\nHowever, we argue that these recent initiatives in fact strengthen our overall argument.\\nWhat characterises EU agreements during a crisis is the severely limited involvement of\\nsupranational EU institutions and their reversion to more intergovernmental governance\\n(see parallels with the Eurocrisis as discussed by Puetter, 2014 or Bickerton et al.,\\n2015). The EU-Turkey Statement, an intergovernmental agreement, is a case in point.\\nThe CJEU recently declared that neither the European Council nor any other institution\\nof the EU was party of the agreement and therefore had no jurisdiction over it (CJEU,\\n2017). With regard to the heavily criticized emergency legislation on quota-based relocation (Council of Ministers 2015a, 2015b), it is important to note that in adopting these\\n‘responsibility-sharing’ measures, Member States have decided to bypass the ordinary\\nlegislative procedure and instead base such legislation on Article 78(3) (TFEU), which\\nexplicitly reverts the role of the European Parliament back to ‘consultation only’. It could\\nbe argued that this was done to speed up the legislation when a fast response was needed.\\nBut perhaps more importantly, it should act as reminder that Member States have generally been much more reluctant to delegate redistributive issues to supranational institutions while being more willing to delegate on regulatory matters (Majone, 1996).\\nOverall, the EU’s response to the crisis therefore strengthens our claim that the delegation to supranational, non-majoritarian, institutions strengthens minority rights in Europe.\\nIt also suggests that the greatest long-term impact of the EU in strengthening refugee protection should be expected to stem from the continuation of an incremental regulatory approach embedded in strong non-majoritarian governance dynamics and is unlikely to\\nresult from highly politicized intergovernmental bargains. While delegation strengthens\\nminority rights and shields them from the preferences of latently anti-immigrant majorities, it is not unproblematic, as it may also further voters’ estrangement from both national\\nand European politics. It may also reinforce the perception that political elites are\\n Eiko Thielemann and Natascha Zaun\\n918\\n © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd\\ndetached from the worries and demands of their voters. This in turn has recently been\\nshown to strengthen right-wing populism and Euroscepticism across Europe.\\n Correspondence:\\nNatascha Zaun\\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science\\nEuropean Institute\\nHoughton Street\\nLondon WC2A 2AE\\nUnited Kingdom\\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7955 6364\\nemail: n.v.zaun@lse.ac.uk\\n'"
