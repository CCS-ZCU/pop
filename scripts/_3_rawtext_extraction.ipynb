This article investigates the impact of populist messages on issue agreement and readiness for\\n',\n 'action in 15 countries (N = 7,286). Specifically, populist communicators rely on persuasive strategies by\\n',\n 'which social group cues become more salient and affect people’s judgment of and political engagement with\\n',\n 'political issues. This strategy is called ‘populist identity framing’ because the ordinary people as the in-group\\n',\n 'is portrayed as being threatened by various out-groups. By blaming political elites for societal or economic\\n',\n 'problems harming ordinary people, populist communicators engage in anti-elitist identity framing. Another\\n',\n 'strategy is to blame immigrants for social problems – that is, exclusionist identity framing. Finally, right-wing\\n',\n 'political actors combine both cues and depict an even more threatening situation of the ordinary people\\n',\n 'as the in-group. Based on social identity theory, an experimental study in 15 European countries shows\\n',\n 'that most notably the anti-elitist identity frame has the potential to persuade voters. Additionally, relative\\n',\n 'deprivation makes recipients more susceptible to the mobilising impact of the populist identity frames.\\n',\n 'Keywords: populism; social identity framing; political psychology; relative deprivation; experiment\\n',\n 'Introduction\\n',\n '‘Either you’re with us, or you’re against us.’\\n',\n 'Conceptualised as a set of ideas emphasising that society is separated into two\\n',\n 'homogenous and antagonistic groups – the ‘good’ ordinary people versus ‘the evil’ others\\n',\n '(Mudde 2004), populist messages can be understood as a social identity frame (cf. Mols\\n',\n '2012). In line with social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner 1986), populist rhetoric frames\\n',\n 'issues as reflecting irreconcilable differences in norms, identities and interests while\\n',\n 'exaggerating intra-group homogeneity and intergroup differences. Key to this populist\\n',\n 'identity frame is the subjective sense of in-group deprivation it calls upon:while the political\\n',\n 'elite benefits from having the upper hand, the people are threatened (Elchardus & Spruyt\\n',\n '2016; Taggart 2000).\\n',\n 'Previous research has focused on the structural conditions on which this perceived sense\\n',\n 'of threat and injustice – manifested in, for instance, economic anxiety or cultural backlash\\n',\n '(Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2017b) – is founded (Rooduijn & Burgoon 2018).

It is within these contexts that it has been shown that voters\\n',\n 'with stronger populist attitudes are more attracted to populist parties (Akkerman et al.\\n',\n '2014; Hawkins et al. 2018; Oliver & Rahn 2016), even when their policy preferences are\\n',\n 'not completely in line with those of a populist party (Van Hauwaert & Van Kessel 2018).\\n',\n 'Most notably, voters that feel more vulnerable are more likely to be supportive of populism\\n',\n '(Rico et al. 2017; Spruyt et al. 2016). In fact, Spruyt et al. (2016: 344) argue that it is at this\\n',\n 'point that ‘psychological coping mechanisms among voters and the politicization of social\\n',\n 'conditions by parties meet’. In other words, populism not only addresses voters’ grievances,\\n',\n 'but reaches out to vulnerable voters by fostering a positive social identity,irrespective of the\\n',\n 'specific social context.\\n',\n 'Even though recent research highlights social identity as a core component of populism\\n',\n '(e.g., Busby et al. 2019; Meléndez & Rovira Kaltwasser 2017; Spruyt et al. 2016), studies\\n',\n 'investigating the psychological impact of this central aspect of populist rhetoric on citizens\\n',\n 'are lacking (but see Schulz et al. 2018). To advance the field, this study provides a theoretical\\n',\n 'framework for understanding the consequences of populism as a social identity frame and\\n',\n 'tests this in a 15-country experiment. Our theoretical framework uses social identity theory\\n',\n '(SIT; Tajfel & Turner 1986) and the social identity model of collective action (SIMCA;\\n',\n 'Van Zomeren et al. 2008) to lay out the observable implications of populist identity\\n',\n 'frames on the persuasion and mobilisation of citizens. To test our expectations, we draw\\n',\n 'on an extensive experiment conducted in 15 countries (N = 7,342). Specifically, the study\\n',\n 'explores the effects of populist identity framing of an economic issue on issue agreement\\n',\n 'and political engagement and investigates the extent to which these effects are dependent\\n',\n 'upon subjective vulnerability – that is, feelings of relative deprivation. In each country\\n',\n 'we conducted an identical online experiment in which we manipulated the presence and\\n',\n 'absence of two out-groups – the political elite and immigrants – in contrast to the presence\\n',\n 'of the national in-group (heartland), resulting in a 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment, with\\n',\n 'a control group. Our results are in line with our expectations for anti-elitist identity frames,\\n',\n 'but not for exclusionary cues.While anti-elitist identity frames are persuasive and mobilising\\n',\n 'among the highly relatively deprived,exclusionist identify frames backfire,especially among\\n',\n 'those feeling less relatively deprived.\\n',\n 'Theory\\n',\n 'Populist communication as an identity frame\\n',\n 'The central idea of populist communication emphasises a binary divide in society:The ‘good’\\n',\n 'ordinary people are opposed to the ‘evil’ and ‘corrupt’ elites (e.g., Mudde 2004; Mudde &\\n',\n 'Rovira Kaltwasser 2017a; Jagers & Walgrave 2007; Taggart 2000). In right-wing populism,\\n',\n 'this core idea or ‘thin-ideology’ (Mudde 2004) is supplemented by nativism, excluding\\n',\n 'societal out-groups such as immigrants or refugees (Aalberg et al. 2017; Jagers & Walgrave\\n',\n '2007; Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2017a). This central populist message is not necessarily\\n',\n 'attached to one actor or communicator,but rather is a frame that can be adopted by different\\n',\n 'actors, such as politicians, journalists or citizens (Aalberg et al. 2017; Aslanidis 2016). Nor\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2019 The Authors.European Journal of Political Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'THE EFFECTS OF POPULISM AS A SOCIAL IDENTITY FRAME\\n',\n '5\\n',\n 'is populism regarded as a binary category, but rather as a matter of degree. Our approach\\n',\n 'to populist communication thus ties in with both the ideational and discursive approaches\\n',\n 'to populism (Hawkins 2010; Laclau 2005; Mudde 2004). Finally, this central idea, or thin-\\n',\n 'ideology, of populism is disseminated through different modes of communication, such as\\n',\n 'politicians’ self-communication on social media, party manifestos, news media or citizens’\\n',\n 'Facebook profiles (Ernst et al. 2017; Krämer 2014; Rooduijn et al. 2014).\\n',\n 'In this research, we specifically distinguish between two elements of populist\\n',\n 'communication (see Aalberg et al. (2017) or Jagers and Walgrave (2007) for similar\\n',\n 'approaches):anti-elitism,anti-immigration and a combination of the two.In line with recent\\n',\n 'research on the mechanisms underlying populist communication (e.g., Busby et al. 2019;\\n',\n 'Hameleers et al. 2017) we can assume that blame-shifting plays a central role. The in-group\\n',\n 'of the ordinary people is described as suffering while at the same time being absolved of\\n',\n 'responsibility. The out-groups, in contrast, are blamed for the problems that ordinary people\\n',\n 'experience.\\n',\n 'This Manichaean outlook on society as divided between the ‘good’ people and the\\n',\n '‘evil’ others is reflected in literature on identity framing. In line with the premises of SIT,\\n',\n 'populist communication invites people to identify with the constructed in-group and primes\\n',\n 'a consistent, positive image of the in-group and of those choosing to identify and thus\\n',\n 'being a part of it (Tajfel & Turner 1986). To reassure and consolidate this positive self-\\n',\n 'identity, negative qualities or situations are attributed to the out-group. The identification\\n',\n 'process underlying populist communication can be regarded as populist identity framing\\n',\n 'by combining the construction of in-group favouritism and out-group hostility (Mols 2012;\\n',\n 'Tajfel & Turner 1986).\\n',\n 'The effects of populist in-group cues on issue agreement\\n',\n 'As explained above, the programmatic focus of populists is dependent upon the (national)\\n',\n 'context (Aalberg et al. 2017; Mudde & Rovira Kaltwasser 2017b; Van Kessel 2015), and\\n',\n 'previous research has indicated that it is plausible that, within boundaries, vulnerable voters\\n',\n 'can be lured into agreement on various issues (Bos et al. 2017; Van Hauwaert & Van Kessel\\n',\n '2018). These two factors combined raise the question whether a message with a populist\\n',\n 'identity frame persuades voters to side with the slant of the message. The in-group/out-\\n',\n 'group distinction that is fostered by populist communication increases the salience of shared\\n',\n 'group membership or in-group identification and fuels out-group derogation (Mols 2012;\\n',\n 'Aalberg et al. 2017). Extant research shows that communications from reference groups\\n',\n 'with whom perceivers share group membership affect people’s judgments (Asch 1955;Sherif\\n',\n '1936). Specifically, when people are uncertain as to whether a given communication is valid,\\n',\n 'norms from a social group with which one identifies can be an important source of influence\\n',\n '(Mackie & Queller 2000; Tajfel & Turner 1986). The in-group of ‘the people’ is constructed\\n',\n 'by applying ‘norm talk’ (cf. Hogg & Giles 2012). The communicated group norms facilitate\\n',\n 'the construction of a shared worldview that is normative for the in-group. In this sense, in-\\n',\n 'group cues in communication have been shown to boost support for policy proposals (Cohen\\n',\n '2003). Additionally, strong in-group identification and similarity among in-group members\\n',\n 'increase the credibility and persuasiveness of in-group sources of messages (Cohen 2003;\\n',\n 'Hogg & Reid 2006; Mackie & Queller 2000).\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2019 The Authors.European Journal of Political Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '6\\n',\n 'LINDA BOS ET AL.\\n',\n 'In the context of populist communication, Hameleers and Schmuck (2017) show that\\n',\n 'messages blaming political elites are more persuasive among audience members who\\n',\n 'identify with the source of the message. As a consequence, in-group recipients of populist\\n',\n 'messages blaming political elites or immigrants for societal crises may be more likely to\\n',\n 'agree with these messages, and may be more convinced that action is needed, than when\\n',\n 'they are exposed to messages depicting societal problems without any blaming of out-groups\\n',\n '(Hogg & Reid 2006; Mackie & Queller 2000). Put differently, when populist actors point to\\n',\n 'societal problems the in-group has to face and hold immigrants or elites responsible for\\n',\n 'these problems, then recipients who share the populist source’s group-membership should\\n',\n 'easily internalise this view and subsequently blame these out-groups for the distress they\\n',\n 'experience (Hogg & Reid 2006).In-group recipients are then more likely to agree with issue\\n',\n 'positions populist messages suggest. In this vein, out-group derogation increases the effect\\n',\n 'of in-group serving bias on persuasion.\\n',\n 'Taken together, when populist actors bring up a specific problem and present themselves\\n',\n 'as the advocate of the people as an in-group that is threatened by out-groups, then this\\n',\n 'group categorisation can make in-group recipients agree that a specific problem is real\\n',\n 'and needs to be addressed. In line with the premises of social identity framing, populism’s\\n',\n 'cultivation of an in-group threat combined with credible scapegoating should foster issue\\n',\n 'agreement (Gamson 1992). More specifically, in the face of threat, populist communication\\n',\n 'offers blame-shifting cues that can consolidate a positive self-concept. In line with the\\n',\n 'previous reasoning, it is hypothesised that anti-elite cues in populist communication (the\\n',\n 'anti-elitist identity frame H1a) and an anti-immigrant or exclusionist identity frame (H1b)\\n',\n 'are more persuasive (i.e., produce more issue agreement) than the depiction of societal\\n',\n 'problems without any out-group blame. In addition, the more extensive the threat from\\n',\n 'out-groups the more relevant in-group cohesion should become. Populist communication\\n',\n 'should accordingly be more persuasive when the threat comes from more than one out-\\n',\n 'group as it likely appears to be more credible and eminent.We therefore hypothesise that the\\n',\n 'combination of anti-immigrant and anti-elitist cues (right-wing populism) will result in the\\n',\n 'strongest in-group threat and will produce even more issue agreement compared to single\\n',\n 'out-group cues alone (H1c).\\n',\n 'The mobilising effects of populist identity framing on readiness for (collective) action\\n',\n 'Research in social psychology has not only shown that the internalisation of in-group norms\\n',\n 'results in persuasion (e.g., Mackie & Queller 2000), but social identity additionally serves\\n',\n 'to mobilise people for social change (e.g., Drury & Reicher 2000). SIMCA (Van Zomeren\\n',\n 'et al. 2008) posits that this is most notably the case when there is perceived injustice and\\n',\n 'when social identity is politicised. The populist identity frame does exactly that. By priming\\n',\n 'in-group favourability and out-group hostility, it constructs a severe threat to the people’s\\n',\n 'in-group status, which is likely to enhance a subjective sense of injustice among those\\n',\n 'who identify with this in-group (e.g., Elchardus & Spruyt 2016; Van Zomeren et al. 2008).\\n',\n 'Research in the field of identity framing has indicated that in-group mobilisation results\\n',\n 'from priming a severe threat to the well-being of the group (e.g., Postmes et al. 1999; Van\\n',\n 'Zomeren et al. 2008), motivating the in-group to take action (e.g., Simon & Klandermans\\n',\n '2001). It is exactly this injustice that is central to the populist identity frame.\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2019 The Authors.European Journal of Political Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'THE EFFECTS OF POPULISM AS A SOCIAL IDENTITY FRAME\\n',\n '7\\n',\n 'Even more fundamentally, populist political communication is likely to contribute to the\\n',\n 'formation of a ‘politicised’ identity of the ordinary people, that can then be referred to,\\n',\n 'activated or primed in future communication. By constructing a positive image of ordinary\\n',\n 'people, who are victimised by elites and/or immigrants (Jagers & Walgrave 2007), populist\\n',\n 'political communication connects people based on their common plight of structural\\n',\n 'disadvantage (Van Zomeren et al. 2008) thus mobilising people ‘as self-conscious group\\n',\n 'members in a power struggle’ (Simon & Klandermans 2001: 319) and bringing ‘a subject\\n',\n 'called “the people” into being’ (Moffitt & Tormey 2014: 389). Being part of the politicised\\n',\n 'people enhances individuals’ motivation to engage in collective action due to a higher ‘inner\\n',\n 'obligation’ to participate in collective political activities (Van Zomeren et al. 2008). Prior\\n',\n 'research underpins this assumption by demonstrating that perceived in-group threat due to\\n',\n 'negative media representations or discrimination results in support for affirmative action\\n',\n '(e.g., Fujioka 2005) and a desire for collective action (e.g., Saleem & Ramasubramanian\\n',\n '2017).\\n',\n 'Integrating populist communication and social identity framing, it can thus be\\n',\n 'hypothesised that populist identity framing mobilises the in-group to engage in collective\\n',\n 'action. Exposure to populist identity framing may thus motivate people to act on behalf of\\n',\n 'their deprived in-group – for example,by sharing information on that threat,or by discussing\\n',\n 'populist communication with people in their network. More specifically, we expect that\\n',\n 'collective action in response to a message increases when the people are portrayed as being\\n',\n 'deprived by the elites (anti-elitist identity frame; H2a) or by immigrants (anti-immigrant\\n',\n 'identity frame; H2b). When an anti-immigration cue is combined with populism’s core\\n',\n 'anti-elitist message (right-wing populism), the threat of in-group deprivation is strongest\\n',\n 'because it results from two enemies. Therefore, we expect the strongest mobilising effects\\n',\n 'on collective action for combined cues (right-wing populism; H2c).\\n',\n 'Perceived relative deprivation as a moderator\\n',\n 'Some citizens may be more susceptible to populist identity framing than others (Hameleers\\n',\n 'et al. 2018b). To investigate who is more likely to be persuaded by the populist message we\\n',\n 'look into a growing body of research that points to different factors driving the success of\\n',\n 'populism (Elchardus & Spruyt 2016; Kriesi et al. 2006; Spruyt et al. 2016).While populist\\n',\n 'attitudes and (congruent) issue positions explain why voters support populist parties, (e.g.,\\n',\n 'Hawkins et al.2018;Van Hauwaert & Van Kessel 2018) to understand who is more attracted\\n',\n 'to the populist message we have to look at other factors. As noted above, not all populist\\n',\n 'voters are classic losers of globalisation (Rooduijn 2018; but see Oesch 2008), but recent\\n',\n 'research has shown that feelings of economic, social and political vulnerability do play\\n',\n 'a key role (Gest et al. 2018; Rico et al. 2017; Spruyt et al. 2016). Those voters that feel\\n',\n 'threatened, ‘having difficulties in finding a positive social identity’ (Spruyt et al. 2016:\\n',\n '344), justified or not, are more likely to feel heard when they are addressed in a populist\\n',\n 'message.\\n',\n 'In this regard, perceptions of relative deprivation can be regarded as one of the most\\n',\n 'central individual-level differences that predict susceptibility to populism (Elchardus &\\n',\n 'Spruyt 2016; Spruyt et al. 2016). Perceptions of relative deprivation can be defined as\\n',\n 'the belief that the resources available in society are not distributed in a fair way (e.g.,\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2019 The Authors.European Journal of Political Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '8\\n',\n 'LINDA BOS ET AL.\\n',\n 'Hogg et al. 2010). Specifically, some groups in society are assumed to benefit more\\n',\n 'from collective resources than others (Elchardus & Spruyt 2016). These perceptions of\\n',\n 'relative deprivation can be connected to the persuasiveness of populist identity framing,\\n',\n 'which constructs a divide between a favoured in-group and a threatening out-group\\n',\n '(Mols 2012). Relative deprivation specifically taps into sentiments of this out-group\\n',\n 'threat. Because some groups are prioritised, the ‘ordinary people’ are left with less\\n',\n 'than they deserve. Perceived deprivation thus concretises and augments the in-group\\n',\n 'threat.\\n',\n 'When social groups perceive themselves as being disadvantaged with respect to the\\n',\n 'distribution of resources compared to out-groups then inter-group conflict is highly likely\\n',\n '(Tajfel & Turner 1986). The feeling of being disadvantaged or deprived will result in an\\n',\n 'increase of in-group liking and out-group hostility (Pettigrew et al. 2008). The derogation\\n',\n 'of an out-group is enhanced when out-group members are explicitly blamed for the alleged\\n',\n 'harm that the in-group experiences. This polarisation of in-group and out-group is stronger\\n',\n 'for in-group members who feel more deprived than others because these individuals\\n',\n 'psychologically benefit more from the in-group serving bias of out-group derogation (Tajfel\\n',\n '& Turner 1986). By emphasising that the in-group is deprived of resources with respect\\n',\n 'to welfare benefits, housing or culture, populist actors increase the feeling of deprivation\\n',\n '(Elchardus & Spruyt 2016),which is likely to resonate most among those message recipients\\n',\n 'who really suffer from social deprivation, such as the unemployed and/or welfare recipients\\n',\n '(for a similar argument, see Schemer 2012). In addition, people who feel more deprived\\n',\n 'compared to others are more persuaded if responsibility for a particular situation is placed\\n',\n 'outside of the individual (Spruyt et al. 2016). By shifting blame onto others, populist\\n',\n 'communication facilitates the individual and in-group related evasion of responsibility.\\n',\n 'Therefore, we argue that relative deprivation moderates the impact of anti-elitist identity\\n',\n 'frames (H3a), anti-immigrant identity frames (H3b) and the combined anti-elitist and anti-\\n',\n 'immigrant populist identity frames (H3c) on persuasion, such that this effect is stronger\\n',\n 'when relative deprivation is higher.\\n',\n 'Relative deprivation may not only increase persuasion but can also enhance mobilisation\\n',\n 'in response to populist identity frames. Previous research suggests that group-based\\n',\n 'comparisons most likely result in collective action when people feel deprived on behalf\\n',\n 'of a relevant reference group due to subjective experiences of unjust disadvantage (Smith\\n',\n '& Ortiz 2002; Van Zomeren et al. 2008). There is a conceptual link between group-based\\n',\n 'comparisons and the inter-group nature of collective action (Postmes et al. 1999; Van\\n',\n 'Zomeren et al. 2008). Individuals who perceive group-based inequality or deprivation may\\n',\n 'see collective action as the most effective way to ameliorate their situation (Kawakami\\n',\n '& Dion 1995) and are most likely to confront those responsible in order to redress this\\n',\n '(Van Zomeren et al. 2008). More specifically, the subjective sense of injustice inherent\\n',\n 'to relative deprivation is likely to foster collective action based on the resulting need\\n',\n 'to improve a negative group identity and to decrease feelings of relative deprivation\\n',\n '(Kawakami & Dion 1995). People thus engage in collective action in an attempt to restore\\n',\n 'the perceived power imbalance between their own in-group and the out-group. Here, it\\n',\n 'should be noted that the means by which people engage do not necessarily require a\\n',\n 'substantial amount of financial or political resources. Social network sites, for example,\\n',\n 'empower people to engage without the investment of much financial resources (or time, for\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2019 The Authors.European Journal of Political Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'THE EFFECTS OF POPULISM AS A SOCIAL IDENTITY FRAME\\n',\n '9\\n',\n '<image: DeviceGray, width: 1000, height: 671, bpc: 8>Figure 1.

In this context, those people who feel worse off than others should\\n',\n 'have the highest motivation to take action against those responsible (Kawakami & Dion\\n',\n '1995). We therefore expect relative deprivation to moderate the mobilising effects of anti-\\n',\n 'elitist identity frames (H4a),anti-immigrant identity frames (H4b) and combined anti-elitist\\n',\n 'and anti-immigrant populist identity cues (H4c) such that this effect is stronger when relative\\n',\n 'deprivation is higher.\\n',\n 'The conceptual model depicting the effect of populist identity framing on issue\\n',\n 'agreement (H1, persuasion) and collective action (H2, mobilisation) and the moderating\\n',\n 'role of relative deprivation is included in Figure 1.\\n',\n 'Research design and method\\n',\n 'The hypotheses derived above are tested within a multinational experiment.

This is in line with recent research (Marx & Nguyen\\n',\n '2018) showing that individuals who feel highly deprived benefit more from blaming the\\n',\n 'elite because they are more vulnerable, given the bad economic situation and, consequently,\\n',\n 'they depend more on collective action to redress their disadvantage (Van Zomeren et al.\\n',\n '2008).\\n',\n 'The quite strong negative impact of the anti-immigrant populist identity frame on\\n',\n 'issue agreement and political engagement is inconsistent with our prior assumptions and,\\n',\n 'therefore, deserves a thorough discussion. We found consistent evidence that the anti-\\n',\n 'immigrant cue in the news story reduced issue agreement and engagement (even more\\n',\n 'than the anti-elite cue enhanced it). One explanation may be that news readers perceived\\n',\n 'the blaming of immigrants for a future loss in purchase power as too blatant and far-\\n',\n 'off. As a consequence, they may have engaged in counter-arguing and questioning the\\n',\n 'credibility of the article (Wegener & Petty 1997). If this was the case, it is unlikely to observe\\n',\n 'more persuasion for participants exposed to the anti-immigrant cue. Another explanation\\n',\n 'would be socially desirable responding (Biernat & Crandall 1999): Maybe the presence of\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2019 The Authors.European Journal of Political Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'THE EFFECTS OF POPULISM AS A SOCIAL IDENTITY FRAME\\n',\n '19\\n',\n 'anti-immigrant cues increased the tendency of participants to censor their true judgments.\\n',\n 'Even if they may have agreed with the slant of the news story, the over-correction of their\\n',\n 'true judgments as a consequence of socially desirable responding would have produced less\\n',\n 'issue agreement when exposed to the anti-immigrant cue, possibly because they perceive\\n',\n 'the message as ‘too populist’. Finally, these results raise questions regarding the distribution\\n',\n 'of findings among more and less tolerant subjects. One explanation could be that especially\\n',\n 'more tolerant voters are dissuaded and demobilised by exclusionist identity frames. Future\\n',\n 'research should look into this by testing whether exclusionist identity framing effects differ\\n',\n 'for respondents with different ideological profiles and immigrant attitudes.10\\n',\n 'While the use of an experimental design increased internal validity aiding us to assess\\n',\n 'the causal impact of our stimuli on the participants, we acknowledge the fact that an online\\n',\n 'survey experiment does not come without its shortcomings. First of all, low quality-answers\\n',\n 'given by ‘professional’ respondents can distort the results. By flagging these respondents in\\n',\n 'the dataset, and running the analyses with and without them we feel confident that we have\\n',\n 'controlled for this problem. Second, one could argue that while an experiment increases\\n',\n 'internal validity, external validity is sacrificed by exposing respondents to a one-shot,\\n',\n 'artificial, stimulus. In order to meet this problem, we minimised artificiality by conducting\\n',\n 'the experiment in an online (i.e., non-laboratory) environment, and exposing respondents\\n',\n 'to a news item that resembled an online news story that may have appeared on a news\\n',\n 'site. Moreover, by running the experiment in 15 countries simultaneously, the study of the\\n',\n 'stability of the experimental effects was included in our design.\\n',\n 'One could note that, as a consequence of pooling the experimental data from the 15\\n',\n 'countries in our study, we end up with a large n of more than 7,000 cases, increasing power\\n',\n 'and hence the likelihood of finding significant results. The country results (presented in\\n',\n 'Online Appendix C) also show that even though individual country results mostly point\\n',\n 'in the same direction as the pooled results, they are less consistent,11 most notably with\\n',\n 'regard to the pooled effects on persuasion. This indicates that, in general, the effects sizes\\n',\n 'are not large, as is common in media effects research. However, it must be noted that the\\n',\n 'results do show that even a marginal manipulation of words leads respondents to change\\n',\n 'their agreement with the issue under study and especially their likelihood to engage in\\n',\n 'political action, be it in a minimal way. This suggests that exposure to a multitude of populist\\n',\n 'messages could lead to much stronger effects,particularly among parts of the electorate that\\n',\n 'are susceptible to it.\\n',\n 'Although the breadth of our multi-country design is the strength of this article, it raises\\n',\n 'questions with regard to the contextual factors conditioning populist communication effects.\\n',\n 'One could postulate that the populist exclusionary frame might resonate more in countries\\n',\n 'with higher immigration or that the populist identity frame has more impact in countries\\n',\n 'with more inequality. In addition, some populist identity frames might be less credible in\\n',\n 'some national contexts, leading to backfire effects (Müller et al. 2017). However, since the\\n',\n '15 countries in our dataset differ in various respects, it is impossible to reliably establish to\\n',\n 'which contextual factor differential effects can be attributed. We call on future research to\\n',\n 'pick this up by taking these possible explanations into account in their case selection and\\n',\n 'pre-registering their expectations. Related, our study cannot shed light on the reasons why\\n',\n 'people feel relatively deprived, because these reasons may largely differ in the countries\\n',\n 'of investigation. However, our results do show that when individuals do feel deprived (for\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2019 The Authors.European Journal of Political Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n '20\\n',\n 'LINDA BOS ET AL.\\n',\n 'whatever reason) they are more susceptible to populist messages and this applies across\\n',\n 'different countries.\\n',\n 'The actual manipulation of populism may be regarded as an additional potential\\n',\n 'limitation. Compared to the control condition, the treatment conditions cultivate both in-\\n',\n 'group preferences as well as blame attribution, and our design does not enable us to tease\\n',\n 'out the isolated effects of these levels of the independent variable. However, in line with\\n',\n 'social identity framing, persuasive and mobilising social identity frames cultivate both an in-\\n',\n 'group threat and a credible scapegoat (e.g.,Polletta & Jasper 2001).We therefore regard our\\n',\n 'manipulation of populism as a social identity frame as valid.Relatedly,as we did not measure\\n',\n 'pre-treatment levels of our dependent variable, our conclusions are based on between-\\n',\n 'subjects comparisons. An important implication is that we cannot fully test the mechanisms\\n',\n 'of SIT. Although pre- and post-treatment measures may allow for a stronger assessment of\\n',\n 'the influence of isolated independent variables,a downside for online experiments is that the\\n',\n 'period between pre- and post-measures is very short, and that the item wordings of the pre-\\n',\n 'treatment may prime scores on the post-treatment. However, in light of these limitations in\\n',\n 'the design of our experiment, we recommend future research to design experiments with\\n',\n 'a more fine-grained manipulation of social identity, while including different dependent\\n',\n 'variables that tease out the effects of social identity framing on different related perceptions.\\n',\n 'That being said, this study makes a significant contribution to our understanding of\\n',\n 'the persuasive and mobilising effects of populist communication. Considering populism’s\\n',\n 'political relevance, it is surprising that our study is one of the first to address these questions.\\n',\n 'Whereas previous research has shown that populism is present in communication at various\\n',\n 'levels (e.g., Ernst et al. 2017; Rooduijn et al. 2014) affecting a plethora of evaluations,\\n',\n 'perceptions and attitudes (Arendt et al. 2015; Bos et al. 2011; Hameleers et al. 2017, 2018b;\\n',\n 'Müller et al. 2017; Sheets et al. 2016), the results in this article make clear that it is because\\n',\n 'of the priming of anti-elitist identity considerations that voters are more likely to agree with\\n',\n 'and be engaged by these messages. In addition, our findings improve our understanding\\n',\n 'of why those citizens that feel disadvantaged (Spruyt et al. 2016) are more likely to be\\n',\n 'persuaded and engaged by populist communication.In the current setting of growing dissent\\n',\n 'of parts of the European electorate, this study has important ramifications, as various actors\\n',\n 'may use populist identity cues – which may even partially explain the success of many\\n',\n 'populist movements around the globe.\\n',\n 'Acknowledgement\\n',\n 'By providing the funds for setting up an interdisciplinary research network this research\\n',\n 'was supported by the European Cooperation on Science and Technology (COST) action\\n',\n 'IS1308 on ‘Populist Political Communication in Europe: Comprehending the Challenge of\\n',\n 'Mediated Political Populism for Democratic Politics’.\\n',\n 'Online Appendix\\n',\n 'Additional supporting information may be found in the Online Appendix section at the end\\n',\n 'of the article.\\n',\n 'C⃝ 2019 The Authors.European Journal of Political Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Consortium for Political Research\\n',\n 'THE EFFECTS OF POPULISM AS A SOCIAL IDENTITY FRAME\\n',\n '21\\n',\n 'Notes\\n',\n '1.

I argue that although non-\\n',\n 'establishment populist leaders or parties are unlikely to emerge\\n',\n 'under the one Party rule, the grassroot political narratives in China\\n',\n 'harbour signiﬁcant latent populist tendencies, and the potential\\n',\n 'for populist rupture is real.\\n',\n 'KEYWORDS\\n',\n 'Populism; Chinese populism;\\n',\n 'populist narratives; cyber\\n',\n 'opinion\\n',\n 'Introduction\\n',\n 'The rise of populism across the world has increasingly garnered the attention of scholars\\n',\n 'and commentators alike. Current research on populism is mostly concentrated in the Euro-\\n',\n 'American region, and the approach is often top-down as it focuses on populist move-\\n',\n 'ments, populist parties and leaders, especially concerning how populism presents as a\\n',\n 'mirror of representative democracies. Less attention is paid to the rise of populism in\\n',\n 'societies without an immediately identiﬁable populist leader or movement. Yet populism\\n',\n 'at its core is about the struggle between imagined political entities: the ‘people’ versus the\\n',\n '‘elite’, and the ‘people’ versus the ‘other’. This kind of conﬂict or political chasm can be\\n',\n 'present in all societies, and not limited to democracy. Indeed, populism is particularly ver-\\n',\n 'satile and can cut across historical periods, geographic boundaries, and ideological clea-\\n',\n 'vages (Gidron & Bonikowski, 2013), and populist rhetoric can be diﬀused and adapted\\n',\n 'across countries (Sawer & Laycock, 2009).\\n',\n 'Therefore, even though the current discussion of populism is mostly in relation to\\n',\n 'democracies, the rise of populism in nondemocratic states should not be ignored. As\\n',\n 'Laclau wrote, ‘the emergence of populism is linked to a crisis of the dominant ideological\\n',\n 'discourse which is in turn part of a more general social crisis’ (Laclau, 1977). China in recent\\n',\n 'years could be said to have seen the advent of these two preconditions. It is now a popular\\n',\n 'consensus that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is undergoing a search for alternative\\n',\n '© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group\\n',\n 'CONTACT Ying Miao\\n',\n 'y.miao2@aston.ac.uk\\n',\n 'Department of Politics and International Relations, Aston University,\\n',\n 'Aston Street, Birmingham, B4 7ET, UK\\n',\n 'CONTEMPORARY POLITICS\\n',\n 'https://doi.org/10.1080/13569775.2020.1727398\\n',\n 'sources of legitimacy as its claims on Marxism-Leninism weakens. Post-reform sociopoliti-\\n',\n 'cal transitions and growing uncertainties associated with the global economic slowdown\\n',\n 'have seen a rise in social discontent and dissent, a crisis of trust and conﬁdence that is felt\\n',\n 'particularly keenly in the internet sphere. The political style of Xi Jinping, which has some-\\n',\n 'times been described as populist (Perry, 2015), further adds to the relevance of exploring\\n',\n 'populism in the Chinese context.\\n',\n 'This paper examines how the core concepts to right-wing populism, including ‘the\\n',\n 'people’, ‘the elite’, and ‘the other’ is constructed and contested in the Chinese cyberspace.\\n',\n 'It is organised in ﬁve main sections. First I will give an overview of populism and the\\n',\n 'diﬀerent deﬁnitions and approaches taken by scholars in the ﬁeld. I will brieﬂy introduce\\n',\n 'the state of the Chinese Internet, and public opinion in the Chinese cyberspace, as well as\\n',\n 'the rationale and context for my enquiry. Focusing on the antagonistic relationship\\n',\n 'between ‘the people’ and ‘the other’ that is central to right-wing populism, I will then\\n',\n 'discuss how these key concepts and relationships are constructed and contested in\\n',\n 'China. I use Chinese netizen’s response to Trumps’ electoral victory as an example to\\n',\n 'show how the relationship between the people and the elite is depicted as one of\\n',\n 'direct answerability and paternalistic responsibility at the grassroot. I then will examine\\n',\n 'how the netizens contextualise the rise of populist right in America in relation to China,\\n',\n 'and how they construct a narrative of ‘must learn lessons’ for China out of the American\\n',\n 'experience, with identiﬁable populist elements. Finally, I will discuss whether it is useful to\\n',\n 'seek populism in China, as it seems contradictory at ﬁrst glance. While a direct and sys-\\n',\n 'tematic comparison of China and populism elsewhere would be diﬃcult due to pre-exist-\\n',\n 'ing diﬀerences in political institutions and context, we should not discount the latent\\n',\n 'populist tendencies embedded in these grassroot narratives, as they, like their counter-\\n',\n 'parts elsewhere in the world, are expressions of sociopolitical discontent, which if left\\n',\n 'unaddressed, could be potentially explosive in the current global climate.\\n',\n 'Populism in Euro-American contexts\\n',\n 'Populism as a political concept is diﬃcult to pin down. It has many forms and is often\\n',\n 'argued to be lacking in core values (Canovan, 2004; Taggart, 2017), thus able to be\\n',\n 'applied to all forms of movements and governments. It has been considered as an ideol-\\n',\n 'ogy, a form of political logic, a type of discourse, a political strategy, and a political style;\\n',\n 'the general agreement in the comparative literature is that populism is ‘confrontational,\\n',\n 'chameleonic, culture-bound and context-dependent’ (Art, 2011).\\n',\n 'When considering populism as an ideology, it is a ‘thin-centred’ one that ‘considers\\n',\n 'society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, “the\\n',\n 'pure people” and “the corrupt elite” and which argues that politics should be an\\n',\n 'expression of the volonté générale (general will) of the people’ (Mudde & Kaltwasser,\\n',\n '2017). The ideology is centred around the popular resentment of the people (inherently\\n',\n 'virtuous) against the elites (exploitative). The rise of mass society post-industrialisation\\n',\n 'especially means that the destruction of old social bonds and the emergence of a new\\n',\n 'commonality that can be called upon to be mobilised against the so-called elites\\n',\n '(Germani, 1978).\\n',\n 'Populism has also been conceived as a political style, where populists overplay the per-\\n',\n 'ception of a threat or crisis with down to earth, ‘bad manners’ and appealing to the people\\n',\n '2\\n',\n 'Y. MIAO\\n',\n 'with their performances (la Torre, 2017; Moﬃtt & Tormey, 2014), and a political strategy,\\n',\n 'where a “personalistic leader seeks or exercises government power based on direct, unme-\\n',\n 'diated, uninstitutionalised support from large numbers of mostly unorganised followers”\\n',\n '(Weyland, 2017). Both the strategy and the style rely on an anti-status quo discourse that\\n',\n '‘simpliﬁes the political space by symbolically dividing society between the people and the\\n',\n 'other’ (Hawkins, 2009; Panizza, 2005), especially appealing to those in the low end of the\\n',\n 'socio-cultural spectrum (Ostiguy, 2017), thus leading to the ‘proletarianisation’ of the right-\\n',\n 'wing populist support base, where the populist frontier is envisaged to be a cultural divide\\n',\n 'as a result of economic decline most sharply felt by the working class (Bornschier & Kriesi,\\n',\n '2012).\\n',\n 'When considering the underlying logic of populism and its eﬀusive discourse, Laclau\\n',\n 'argues that populism only arises when there is a ‘building up of an internal frontier divid-\\n',\n 'ing the social space into two camps’, resulting in the construction of a ‘popular subject’\\n',\n '(Laclau, 2005b). Thus, populism is a politics of diﬀerence, best operationalised as a political\\n',\n 'language that emphasises a fundamental divide between people and elites, upholding the\\n',\n 'primacy of the former and accusing the latter of attempting to capture social, political, and\\n',\n 'economic institutions for their narrow interests (Aslanidis, 2017).\\n',\n 'Regardless of conceptual approach, There are three key elements in populism: a central,\\n',\n 'antagonistic relationship between the people and the elite; an attempt to restore popular\\n',\n 'sovereignty, which implies that there is a transparent and readily accessible will of the\\n',\n 'people to all those willing to listen; and the idea of the people as homogenous unity,\\n',\n 'which often leads to antagonistic views against those who do not ﬁt in (Abts & van\\n',\n 'Kessel, 2015). However, most of the analyses on populism are top-down and after-the-\\n',\n 'fact, focused either on emerging populist ‘politics in power’ or the transformation of\\n',\n 'state discourse to ﬁll a populist agenda (Robinson & Milne, 2017). What, then, of\\n',\n 'regimes where populist forces are unlikely to gain political power, yet populist ‘symptoms’\\n',\n 'and discourses are gaining in popularity? With this in mind, the paper will turn to examine\\n',\n 'how the three protagonists in populist discourse (the people, the elite, and the ‘other’) are\\n',\n 'narratively constructed and represented in the Chinese cyberspace.\\n',\n 'The Chinese internet, netizens and online public opinion\\n',\n 'According to the oﬃcial 40th Statistical Report on Internet Development in China, China’s\\n',\n 'internet penetration rate is at 54.3% in June 2017, with 7.51 billion netizens, 5 billion of\\n',\n 'which come from urban areas (CNNIC, 2017). Education and income are signiﬁcant indi-\\n',\n 'cators of internet use: a large majority of internet users are concentrated in the most pros-\\n',\n 'perous cities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. Generally it is seen that the\\n',\n 'internet has led to an increased awareness of the general public of the sociopolitical\\n',\n 'environment that they inhabit, and a greater need to express themselves politically\\n',\n '(Peng, 2008). Due to censorship and regulations, however, such participation often\\n',\n 'happens in non-conventional ways. Often unable to comment on domestic politics\\n',\n 'directly, topics of international politics are vibrant outlets of opinion on social media\\n',\n 'and oﬀer valuable insight into how the participants approach politics as a whole. It is\\n',\n 'with this in mind that the netizen’s response to Donald Trump’s electoral victory in the\\n',\n '2016 American election was chosen as a topic for understanding how populist discourses\\n',\n 'are constructed at the grassroot in the Chinese cyberspace.\\n',\n 'CONTEMPORARY POLITICS\\n',\n '3\\n',\n 'While the opinions of netizens cannot be substituted for the opinions of the whole\\n',\n 'society, it is nevertheless reﬂective of changing sociopolitical attitudes in China. Traditional\\n',\n 'media has always been the mouthpiece of the elites, and even more so due to China’s pro-\\n',\n 'paganda system. Internet opinion, on the other hand, often post a stylistically and struc-\\n',\n 'turally opposite: by function, then, the internet is conducive to populism (Krämer, 2014). In\\n',\n 'China, where opportunities for oﬄine political participation is limited, online activity often\\n',\n 'can inﬂuence public and media opinion as a whole, and even aﬀecting the direction and\\n',\n 'outcome of oﬄine sociopolitical events (Bi, 2015). Conventional media have also devel-\\n',\n 'oped a symbiotic relationship with new media, as they often follow online cues to disse-\\n',\n 'minate netizen’s opinions to a wider audience. Thus, the internet can play a signiﬁcant role\\n',\n 'in populism because it forces the government to recognise and respond to whatever\\n',\n 'issues the netizens are deeming unjust, in the absence of more robust intermediary\\n',\n 'legal institutions (Tang, 2016).\\n',\n 'Sampling and methods\\n',\n 'For this study, the website of Zhihu was chosen as the ﬁeld site. Zhihu, meaning ‘do you\\n',\n 'know?’ in classical Chinese, is essentially a Quora-esque question and answer platform in\\n',\n 'China. According to oﬃcial data, in 2017 Zhihu has 68 million registered users, 18.5 million\\n',\n 'daily active users, 75 billion pages views per month, with an average visit lasting 40 min\\n',\n '(Zhihu, 2017). According to two big data reports, university students, especially those\\n',\n 'from prestigious universities such as the 985/211 group, and white-collar professionals\\n',\n 'constitute the majority of the user base (J. Peng, 2017; Yiyu, 2017). Gender-wise the\\n',\n 'user base is more or less evenly split (51% male to 48% female) and most of the user\\n',\n 'live in developed cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. The reason Zhihu, as opposed to\\n',\n 'Weibo, was chosen was because the nature of Zhihu’s platform allowed elaborate\\n',\n 'answers compared to the 140 character limit of Weibo, and the upvotes system allows\\n',\n 'a relatively straight forward way to assess audience receptivity to the answers and ideas\\n',\n 'presented by each commenter. Furthermore, the topic of Trump’s electoral victory was\\n',\n 'chosen because it was a protracted political event that gathered much attention in the\\n',\n 'Chinese cyberspace, and the answers to various populist elements in Trump’s campaign\\n',\n 'were detailed, rich and varied, thus able to shed light on how netizens understood politics,\\n',\n 'both domestic and abroad, as a whole. Although the discussions surrounding Trump con-\\n',\n 'tains no anti-establishment agenda to challenge the domestic status quo, the way the\\n',\n 'netizens subsume and instrumentalise key populist logic and styles oﬀers valuable\\n',\n 'insight into how politics is understood in contemporary China (Zhang, 2019). Indeed,\\n',\n 'many answers directly drew parallel with China’s past in their attempt to comprehend\\n',\n 'the outcome of the election, and forewarned similar fates befalling Chinese politics and\\n',\n 'society when they saw parallels with China’s present.\\n',\n 'Sampling was a multistage process. First, most popular questions under the topic\\n',\n 'Donald Trump was identiﬁed according to page views and number of followers to the\\n',\n 'question. Then, for each question, the most popular answers are recorded. The criteria\\n',\n 'for selection are that it must be an original answer by the commenter, have at least\\n',\n '1,000 upvotes or more, or ranked top 10 in the page. As Zhihu uses the Wilson interval\\n',\n 'for its algorithms, this allows the sampling to include both popular but controversial\\n',\n 'answers (an answer with a lot of upvotes but ranked lower means it has received a lot\\n',\n '4\\n',\n 'Y. MIAO\\n',\n 'of downvotes as well), and answers that are both popular and less contested. A total of 65\\n',\n 'answers from 7 most popular questions were collected. The sampled data are ﬁrst coded\\n',\n 'line-by-line then analysed and organised into secondary themes using NVivo12.\\n',\n 'Grassroot populist narratives: netizens’ response to Trump\\n',\n 'The people\\n',\n 'All discussions of government, especially legitimate government, must involve the idea of\\n',\n '‘the people’, as all political associations are creations of its members and must in various\\n',\n 'ways respond to them (Kaltwasser, Taggart, Espejo, & Ostiguy, 2017). Whereas ‘the people’\\n',\n 'as a source of political authority underlines modern democracy, the ‘sovereign people’ as a\\n',\n 'uniﬁed entity able to challenge and retrieve power from the state paves way for the rise of\\n',\n 'populism (Bourke & Skinner, 2016). However, both the nature and the function of the\\n',\n 'people as a political entity is highly contested and often indeterminate. By populist\\n',\n 'identiﬁcation, the people can refer to both the idea of the underdog (plebs) and as a\\n',\n 'holder of sovereignty (demos), or even the ethnos, and the populist discourse often\\n',\n 'emphasises the legitimate claims of the demos or ethnos being denied as they are\\n',\n 'made into plebs by the political establishment (Kazin, 1998). In the populist view, politics\\n',\n 'is legitimised only if the people’s will is followed, both as a constitutional ground and as a\\n',\n 'revolutionary force: whereas a democrat’s claim to the invocation of the people is limited,\\n',\n 'populists draw their power from the unlimitable claims on the ‘real voice’ of the ‘real\\n',\n 'people’ (Espejo, 2017). The simpliﬁcation of politics, usually presented in antagonistic\\n',\n 'ways, is often the result.\\n',\n 'The people-as-underdog discourse feature heavily in the Chinese netizen’s Trump nar-\\n',\n 'rative. The people as a political group is seen as inherently virtuous, but in the current pol-\\n',\n 'itical climate, they are wronged, oppressed and voiceless. The reason for this people-as-\\n',\n 'underdog condition is attributed to the hypocrisy and ignorance of the governing\\n',\n 'elites. Contrary to their ‘moral loftiness’, the people are seen as down-to-earth, often strug-\\n',\n 'gling, in a political climate where political correctness has overshadowed their struggle for\\n',\n 'survival. Thus, ‘the people’ is immediately pitted against those who are deemed to have\\n',\n 'robbed them of their rights and livelihoods as legitimate productive citizens in the\\n',\n 'society: often the minority groups, who, according to the commenters, do not satisfy\\n',\n 'the moral criteria to be included in mainstream society.\\n',\n 'The people don’t care about political correctness, or social justice, they just want a better life.\\n',\n 'When they go out to ﬁnd that better life, they ﬁnd their jobs stolen by illegal immigrants. They\\n',\n 'can’t aﬀord utility, let alone university. They are angry — why are the mainstream media\\n',\n 'talking about things they don’t care? Why are the immigrants stealing their jobs and why\\n',\n 'are the beneﬁt queens robbing the country? (Gaius, 6600 upvotes)\\n',\n 'The needs and the will of the people are generalised, and packaged to be simple, hom-\\n',\n 'ogenous and easily graspable; indeed much of the outrage and indignation is directed\\n',\n 'at the seemingly deliberate ignorance of the elites towards the ‘real problem’: that\\n',\n 'honesty and hard work goes unrewarded and opportunistic minority groups are taking\\n',\n 'advantage of the people. Already we see that ‘the people’ is conceptualised to occupy\\n',\n 'a diﬀerent discursive position to the ‘other’ and ‘the elite’, and the people’s relationship\\n',\n 'CONTEMPORARY POLITICS\\n',\n '5\\n',\n 'with the former is seen as fundamentally antagonistic, while with the latter is with disap-\\n',\n 'pointment and antipathy.\\n',\n 'First you need to be able to live.

By suggesting that the\\n',\n 'elites overlooked the fundamental needs of the people, the commenters are essentially\\n',\n 'criticising the elites’ lack of ‘common sense’ while overlooking the complexity of social\\n',\n 'problems, another recurrent theme in populist discourses.\\n',\n 'Equal rights is something that you [the elites] care about, not what the unemployed care\\n',\n 'about. If equal rights is what the people cared about, then Trump wouldn’t have gotten\\n',\n 'into power. The people care about unemployment, and how their pleas for action go unan-\\n',\n 'swered. (WY, 5000 upvotes)\\n',\n 'Usually, populist rhetorics seek to draw upon the grievance of the ordinarily margina-\\n',\n 'lised social sectors, with the goal to mobilise them into publicly visible and contentious\\n',\n 'political action (Roberts, 2015a). However, it is worth noting that according to user\\n',\n 'demography, most of Zhihu’s active users are white-collar and relatively well-oﬀ, a\\n',\n 'fact that is well acknowledged in the community, which considers itself ‘middle class’.\\n',\n 'Nevertheless, their conception of ‘the people’ still see themselves and their peers as\\n',\n 'underdogs and powerless. The high sense of relative deprivation and material anxiety\\n',\n 'among the middle class could account for this (Miao, 2017; Rocca, 2016). While the pol-\\n',\n 'itical characteristics of the Chinese middle class has been shown to be social stabilisers\\n',\n 'due to their vested interests in the state (J. Chen, 2013; Tomba, 2004), the middle class\\n',\n 'in China have been squeezed in recent years due to rising costs of living, and limited\\n',\n 'social welfare as safety net (Miao, 2016b). The perception of the middle class under\\n',\n 'threat is often the beginning of political simpliﬁcation and leads to the polarisation of\\n',\n 'the rich vs the poor (Atkinson & Brandolini, 2013). It is clear that the commenters are\\n',\n 'empathising with the poor and identifying them as their peers in the context of ‘the\\n',\n 'people’, as they did not hesitate to speak on the poor’s behalf and advocate for their\\n',\n 'realpolitik:\\n',\n 'The poor wouldn’t care about Trump’s discrimination against women and Muslims. If follow-\\n',\n 'ing Washington would get you your own land, would you care if Washington had many slaves\\n',\n 'and many wives? (WY, 5000 upvotes)\\n',\n 'Thus the netizens understood the American election in populist terms: that the outcome\\n',\n 'of the election was an eﬀective expression of the will of the people, despite the interven-\\n',\n 'tions of distrustful intermediary institutions such as the media, hence it was to be\\n',\n 'celebrated.\\n',\n 'The people have chosen what they want. The media always thinks as long as they control the\\n',\n 'dominant discourse they can deceive the people. No way! (LYM, 1000 upvotes)\\n',\n '6\\n',\n 'Y. MIAO\\n',\n 'Trump’s electoral victory is therefore seen to have uncovered the unifying qualities of the\\n',\n 'people: courage, honesty, and perseverance, as opposed to the misgiving qualities of ‘the\\n',\n 'other’. The celebration of how ‘real elites’ have wrestled control back from the establish-\\n',\n 'ment echo the core tenants of populism elsewhere (Roberts, 2015a).\\n',\n 'The elites\\n',\n 'In populist discourses, the people often serve as an ‘empty signiﬁers’, as a marker for\\n',\n 'internal division, and calls forth a political subject that is in need of reclaiming its\\n',\n 'power, representation and sovereignty from the anti-popular ‘other’ (Laclau, 2005a).\\n',\n 'This anti-populist other, usually the establishment and the elite, is therefore of signiﬁcance,\\n',\n 'because in their role as the common enemy of the people, they also serve as the ‘equiv-\\n',\n 'alential linkage’ that can homogenise a variety of unsatisﬁed demands. Whether the ‘elite’\\n',\n 'is understood in socioeconomic or cultural terms, the emphasis in populist rhetorics is\\n',\n 'always on the oppositional character of elites, or the powerful, to the people (Mudde,\\n',\n '2004).\\n',\n 'There is an interesting contrast between how the elites are conceptualised in populist\\n',\n 'discourses in Euro-America and in China. The elites in Chinese narratives are not seen as\\n',\n 'corrupt or anti-people by nature, as some populist discourses in Euro-America would\\n',\n 'suggest, instead, their narratives focus on the failure of the elites to carry out their pater-\\n',\n 'nalistic duty. As such, there is an underlying assumption that elites should be the cham-\\n',\n 'pion of the will of the people, and do not necessarily have to occupy an opposite\\n',\n 'political space by their deﬁnition. The problem only arises when they misuse their position\\n',\n 'of power:\\n',\n 'Elites like control … because they are overconﬁdent and have vested interests.

Conversely, authoritarian leaders often resolve to\\n',\n 'populist goals and strategies in order to further their claims on legitimacy.

MIAO\\n',\n 'Moreover, fundamental elements of populist narrative, and key features of populist\\n',\n 'logic, are not exclusive to any one type of political system. If we see populism as a dimen-\\n',\n 'sion of political action, as Taguieﬀ argues, then it can be synthesised with all forms of gov-\\n',\n 'ernments. The political use of populism is versatile: democracies can be hijacked and\\n',\n 'overturned by populist leaders, but authoritarian leaders can also legitimise themselves\\n',\n 'through populist means (Taguieﬀ, 1995). Indeed, populism is by no means irrelevant in\\n',\n 'China: the continuing ideology of mass line, weak institutionalisation and direct govern-\\n',\n 'ment response suggest that the country might be moving towards populist authoritarian-\\n',\n 'ism as its mode of rule (Tang, 2016). Like Russia, which adopts populist rhetorics as a tool of\\n',\n 'regime stabilisation (Robinson & Milne, 2017), in recent years we have seen top political\\n',\n 'ﬁgures in the CCP turning towards populism as a way to rekindle popular enthusiasm\\n',\n 'and support. The meteoric rise and fall of Bo Xilai proved that leaders can quickly\\n',\n 'amass and enjoy populist success, and while Bo’s populist bid for leadership has failed,\\n',\n 'Xi Jinping has certainly incorporated populist styles and strategies to bolster his own\\n',\n 'support base (Fewsmith, 2013). Henceforth, even though a non-establishment populist\\n',\n 'leader is unlikely to rise under the CCP’s tight control, the CCP continues to rely at least\\n',\n 'partially on populist strategies in order to legitimise and secure political support.\\n',\n 'More importantly, populism often arises out of sociopolitical discontent, which\\n',\n 'expresses itself along simpliﬁed and antagonistic forms of political order, with the idea\\n',\n 'of the ‘people’ at the core. The moral distinction of ‘us’ versus ‘them’ is at the core of\\n',\n 'this antagonism, which pits the people both vertically against the elite, and horizontally\\n',\n 'against the ‘other’ (Brubaker, 2017). What is striking in the case of Chinese netizens dis-\\n',\n 'cussed in this paper, is that they have subsumed and responded to the prevalent populist\\n',\n 'narratives surrounding Trump’s electoral victory, and applied similarly polarising argu-\\n',\n 'ments to politics in general.

Thus, the netizen’s narrative\\n',\n 'framing of politics takes an essentially polarising and populist form, which transcends\\n',\n 'national boundaries: the netizen’s understanding of U.S. politics here is a reﬂection of\\n',\n 'how they understand politics back home.\\n',\n 'As we have seen, the moral divide of ‘us versus them’ is prevalent in Chinese netizen’s\\n',\n 'narrative construction of the global political order. Part of this construction is encouraged\\n',\n 'by the oﬃcial CCP discourse, where the appeal to the people is often an appeal to the\\n',\n 'ethnos rather than the demos (Carrico, 2016). Underlying the populist nationalistic senti-\\n',\n 'ments is a sense of moral commitment that grows out of membership in the community\\n',\n '(Yong, 2017), which feeds into the narrative that there are moral criteria for ‘the people’ or\\n',\n 'to qualify as ‘the mainstream’ in Chinese society.

This\\n',\n 'has a few implications in the context of emerging grassroot populist trends in China.\\n',\n 'First, the lack of anti-establishment mood does not mean a lack of sociopolitical grie-\\n',\n 'vance, general or speciﬁc. In the netizen’s narrative framework, they do not distinguish\\n',\n 'between political elites at the central level and the local level, but focus on the juxtaposi-\\n',\n 'tion of the elites being diﬀerent to the people. Although they have exhibited little anti-elite\\n',\n 'mood in the Chinese domestic context, the netizens have used such polarising and popu-\\n',\n 'list imaginings to legitimise their critique of elites in the U.S., whom they perceive as\\n',\n 'having failed in their paternalistic duty. The signiﬁcance of such populist awareness\\n',\n 'should not be overlooked, even though the likelihood of it challenging the state in the\\n',\n 'current Chinese context is low.\\n',\n 'Another paradoxical implication of a mismatch in trust between central and local gov-\\n',\n 'ernment is that the Chinese public often seek and expect paternalistic protection from the\\n',\n 'central government and even singular leaders, thus weakening intermediary institutions in\\n',\n 'the process. Indeed, there is evidence that bureaucratic fragmentation has led the central\\n',\n 'government to deliberately expose corruption at the local level to redirect public criticism\\n',\n 'away from the central organs (Manion, 2004), and the protesters responding in kind by\\n',\n 'using central government rules and regulations to back up their grievances levelled\\n',\n 'against local governments and oﬃcials (O’brien & Li, 2005).\\n',\n 'Finally, due to the paternalistic expectation for the elites, there is also the threat of the\\n',\n 'establishment othering itself. As we have seen, netizens, who empathise with ‘the people’\\n',\n 'and ‘the masses’, are only ready to accept elite leadership if the elites are seen as repre-\\n',\n 'senting their interests. In ideology at least, the CCP has pledged this: in Party propaganda\\n',\n 'literature, the word ‘people’ is most often referred to as the base of support for the CCP. It\\n',\n 'is the CCP’s fundamental mission to represent the ‘interests of the people’, which, like the\\n',\n 'imagined general will of the people in populist discourse, is seen as homogenous, trans-\\n',\n 'parent and easily accessible. However, this is a tight line to walk, because ‘the people’ is\\n',\n 'too elusive a concept, and ‘the general will’ too diverse and diﬃcult to ascertain. When\\n',\n 'the people recognise and sanction the eﬀort of the Party to purify its ranks, populist pol-\\n',\n 'icies such as the anti-corruption campaign can work to increase the legitimacy of the CCP.\\n',\n 'On the other hand, as long as the CCP continues to emphasise the vanguard role of the\\n',\n 'Party and its cadres in juxtaposition with the people or the masses, it risks ‘othering’\\n',\n 'itself, and risks being labelled as the exploitative elite as long as its performance fails to\\n',\n 'align with the expectations of the people. The tension between responsiveness and\\n',\n 'responsibility (Mudde & Kaltwasser, 2018) that has led to the rise of populism in demo-\\n',\n 'cratic regimes is not wholly absent in China’s paternalistic authoritarianism. Therefore,\\n',\n 'although non-establishment populist leaders or parties are unlikely to emerge under\\n',\n 'the one Party rule, the grassroot political narratives in China harbour signiﬁcant latent\\n',\n 'populist tendencies, and the potential for populist rupture should not be overlooked.\\n',\n 'Conclusion\\n',\n 'Populism at the core tries to deal with several essential questions: what went wrong, who\\n',\n 'is to blame, and how do we ﬁx it? (Betz & Johnson, 2004) In the Euro-American case, the\\n',\n '16\\n',\n 'Y. MIAO\\n',\n 'answers are: the government (who is supposed to represent the people) has been hijacked\\n',\n 'by the elites, who are to blame for the social injustices, and the people, seen as a virtuous\\n',\n 'and homogenous entity, must reclaim their power through the help of populist leaders\\n',\n 'and parties (McDonnell & Albertazzi, 2017). However, such populist logic rests on\\n',\n 'several key underlying assumptions: that something is wrong, someone is to blame,\\n',\n 'and it can be ﬁxed. These assumptions do not translate well in the Chinese case. Populist\\n',\n 'reasoning in China is preemptive, almost a warning: instead of constructing an elite that is\\n',\n 'hijacking the supposedly representative and neutral institutions of government, the elite\\n',\n 'in China is the government. Populist discourses warn instead that the power of the elites\\n',\n 'can only be legitimised by them serving the interests of the people, a claim which, at ﬁrst\\n',\n 'glance, the CCP supports in its oﬃcial discourse. However, the authoritarian nature of\\n',\n 'Chinese politics means that it is in the Party’s interest to monopolise the deﬁnition of\\n',\n 'the people and its general will, as to foreclose any populist uprisings. This lands the\\n',\n 'CCP in a paradoxical position if it is to boost legitimacy from popular support bases: on\\n',\n 'the one hand, it claims to be the champion of the general will of the people, on the\\n',\n 'other hand, it is not simply reactive to the people’s will but also seek to take a proactive\\n',\n 'part in shaping it. By claiming the former, the CCP could potentially risk becoming ‘the\\n',\n 'other’ if and when popular demands can no longer be satisﬁed. The latent populist ten-\\n',\n 'dencies in Chinese politics should therefore not be discounted, as they, like their counter-\\n',\n 'parts elsewhere in the world, are expressions of deep-seated sociopolitical discontent,\\n',\n 'which if left unaddressed, could be potentially explosive in the current global climate.\\n',\n 'Note\\n',\n '1.
