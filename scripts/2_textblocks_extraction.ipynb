They acquire their image of political\\nleaders through the mass media, either directly or indirectly by means of interpersonal\\ncommunication about newspaper articles or programs on radio or TV. Within the context\\nof mediatization (Mazzoleni & Schulz, 1999), all political parties and their party leaders\\nare thus dependent upon the media for the dissemination of their ideas and the shaping of\\ntheir image (Sheafer, 2001).\\nHowever, common wisdom and an abundance of literature on the right-wing pop-\\nulist party family could lead us to believe that right-wing populist party leaders rely\\neven more than mainstream party leaders on the media for their image (Mazzoleni,\\nStewart, & Horsﬁeld, 2003). Especially because they are often new to the political spec-\\ntrum, they need the media to be known by the electorate; (positive) media coverage is\\ncrucial for their electoral breakthrough (see, for instance, Art, 2007; Deutchman & Ellison,\\n1999; Mudde, 2007). Moreover, the strong charismatic populist leaders, whom these\\nparties are known for, can exert a larger inﬂuence on changes in their image than\\nother, mainstream party leaders. Their (party) populist style shares the key traits of\\nmedia logic, including personalization, emotionalization, and an anti-establishment atti-\\ntude (Plasser & Ulram, 2003), and can therefore lead to exaggerated media attention from\\nwhich they can proﬁt (Mudde, 2007).\\nOn the other hand, research on the right-wing populist party family has shown that\\nthese parties and their electorates do not differ that much from mainstream parties. Support\\nfor right-wing populist parties is motivated by the same ideological and pragmatic con-\\nsiderations as support for other parties (Mudde, 2007; van der Brug, Fennema, & Tillie,\\n2000, 2003), leader effects are of the same size and sometimes even smaller (van der\\nBrug & Mughan, 2007), and government participation of these parties is “a relatively ordi-\\nnary phenomenon” (de Lange, 2008, p. 224). And there is a media-centric reason not to\\nexpect larger media effects for right-wing populists compared to mainstream party leaders:\\n',\n  11,\n  0)]"
