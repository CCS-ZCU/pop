      "It is often argued that right-wing populist party leaders are dependent on the media\n",
      "for their public image, which in turn is key for their electoral success. This study teststhis assumption by comparing the effects of the media coverage of 2 Dutch right-wingpopulist leaders with the effects of the coverage of leaders of established parties, in areal-life setting, by tracking campaign developments in the Dutch 2006 national elec-tion campaign. We combine panel survey data ( n=401) with repeated measurements\n",
      "of the party leaders’ public images with a systematic content analysis of 17 media out-lets (with a total of 1,001 stories), on the basis of the media consumption of individualrespondents. Our results show signiﬁcant effects of the content of media coverage onthe public image of political leaders. However, only in 1 case (out of 10) is there asigniﬁcant difference between right-wing populist party leaders and leaders of otherparties in the strength of media effects. It thus seems that leaders of right-wing populistparties are just as dependent upon the media as leaders of other parties. The ﬁndingsare discussed in the light of extant research on right-wing populist parties and mediapopulism.\n",

In order to be successful electorally, these right-wing populist party lead-\\ners do not only have to be known by the public, they also need voters to have a positive\\nimage of them (Bos & van der Brug, 2010); they need to be perceived to be effective and\\nlegitimate.\\nIn order to get media attention, leaders of right-wing populist parties have to be some-\\nwhat extraordinary in their behavior, style, or in their messages: “It is a truism that the\\nmedia simply cannot ignore what is newsworthy, and clearly newsworthy are the politicians\\nwho defy the existing order, with their abrasive language, public protests, and emotive\\nissues” (Mazzoleni, 2003, pp. 6–7). Thus, on the one hand, they might employ populist\\nrhetoric or a populist style (Jagers & Walgrave, 2007). On the other hand, these lead-\\ners also have to appear authoritative by displaying their knowledge on issues addressed.\\nRecent research has indicated that successful right-wing populist leaders have managed to\\nreach a delicate balance between appearing unusual and populist, or anti-establishment, to\\ngain news value and still appear authoritative (Bos, van der Brug, & de Vreese, 2010).\\nHowever, whether right-wing populists really are dependent upon the media for their\\npublic image, and whether they differ from mainstream party leaders in this respect, has\\nnever directly been tested. In this article, we address this scientiﬁc gap by testing the effects\\nof the media coverage of right-wing populist leaders on changes in the perception of these\\nleaders in a dynamic setting by tracking campaign developments. We contribute to extant\\nresearch in several respects. First of all, we add to the growing research ﬁeld on right-\\nwing populist parties by taking a closer look at media effects on perceptions of leaders\\nof these parties. Second, we do not only look at one speciﬁc aspect in the coverage of\\nthese leaders, such as prominence, visibility, or tone of coverage, but build a parsimonious\\nmodel including three dimensions in the depiction of these leaders: their prominence, their\\nauthoritativeness—which refers to how knowledgeable a politician appears to be—and the\\nextent to which they use a populist style or adhere to populist ideology.\\nThird, we draw on previous research on the public image of right-wing populist leaders\\nin which two aspects were found that are important for their electoral success: effectiveness\\nand legitimacy (Bos & van der Brug, 2010). All (new) party leaders, right-wing populist\\nor mainstream, have to be perceived to be effective (i.e., able to affect policies or inﬂu-\\nence the public debate) in order to be seen as a serious political contestant.
